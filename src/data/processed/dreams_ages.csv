0,bea1,Bea 1: a high school student,1,07/07/2003 (age 14),"I am on a trip to Italy with a lot of my friends and their families. I am thoroughly frustrated because most of the girls on the trip are my age and most of the boys are juniors and seniors. All the girls are acting slutty and fake and all the boys are buying it. I like Albert and he keeps being stolen away by a group of slutty girls. Everyone is ignoring me. So that night (in my dream), I just cried myself to sleep. I remember there being about 100 twin size beds just lined up against the walls. There was one room for the adults and one room for the kids. Everyone was talking loudly and having fun and no one noticed me crying. I am woken in the middle of the night (in my dream) to find Albert sitting on the edge of my bed. I remember seeing his deep blue eyes and they shone in the moonlight. I also remember looking around and seeing all the 100 beds completely empty. So then Albert leaned down and just kissed me really innocently and sweetly. But then there was a knock on the door so he pulled away and looked really afraid. He said, ""I'll come back later"" and left. Then I woke up because my mother really was knocking on my door to wake me up.",trip italy lot friend family thoroughly frustrate girl trip age boys junior senior girl act slutty fake boy buy like albert keep steal away group slutty girl everyone ignore night dream cry sleep remember twin size bed line wall one room adults one room kid everyone talk loudly fun one notice cry woken middle night dream find albert sit edge bed remember see deep blue eye shone moonlight also remember look around see bed completely empty albert lean kiss really innocently sweetly knock door pull away look really afraid say come back later leave wake mother really knock door wake,8.787896,9.483524,231,2,2,0,1,2,3,1,1,6,5,0

We are in the main building and for some reason we are taking the elevator down to the dining hall. So all of a sudden it stops really quickly and I fall to my knees and am perfectly waist level with both of them. So for some odd reason I think that they want me to give them head and I am really embarrassed so I stand up very quickly. When we reach the dining hall, it's packed with the entire school and then some. So Nick, Aidan, and I get out of the elevator.

2,bea1,Bea 1: a high school student,3,07/09/2003 (age 14),"I dreamed that there was this war happening and that I was much more involved than I am in the war now In class we would have drills pertaining to the war. It was really scary. So all the freshmen and sophomores went on this trip and Sue and I were left behind. So when the trip returned everyone sought to create everyone's worst nightmare. All these people were chasing me and trying to shoot me, which I guess is my worst nightmare. I ran into my house, which was like the Order of the Phoenix in Harry Potter. Mr. Bailey was there with a palette of nail polish, trying to communicate some code to me. But I couldn't figure it out. So then I escaped to a kind of vineyard where Sue's worst fear was being realized. Her worst fear was that everyone had found out some secret about her. So there were all these freshmen and sophomores tormenting her in the trees of the vineyard, saying things like, ""We know, Sue..."" and then I remember one of them saying ""We know about Abbylius,"" (I just made that name up in my dream) and then I woke up.",dream war happen much involve war class would drill pertain war really scary freshman sophomore go trip sue leave behind trip return everyone sought create everyone worst nightmare people chase try shoot guess bad nightmare run house like order phoenix harry potter mr bailey palette nail polish try communicate code figure escape kind vineyard sue bad fear realize bad fear everyone find secret freshman sophomore torment tree vineyard say thing like know sue remember one say know abbylius make name dream wake,5.9107337,11.883272,202,4,0,0,5,3,2,2,4,6,6,0
3,bea1,Bea 1: a high school student,4,07/10/2003 (age 14),"I dreamed that I was on this train. In each different car was a different song playing. And no matter how much I liked the song that was playing, I was forced into the next car. It was really hot in the train so I was wearing my bathing suit. The train stopped at my high school's dining hall. I went in and everyone was studying for exams. I sat down at a table with my friends in my bathing suit. Ashley came up behind Olivia and put a lobster in her hair and we all screamed. Then she came after me with another lobster, so I ran away. I finally got back to my table and grabbed my bags before heading back to my dorm. On the way I saw Matthew and David, but they ignored me. Frustrated, I parachuted (yes, parachuted) away. I was so scared of Olivia and angry that Matthew and David had ignored me. When I got to the dorm, I realized that it was the beginning of school, even though I had just seen everyone studying for final exams. I realized I didn't live here anymore, so then I rushed to my new dorm where I found Sue. She told me that she, Hannah, 3 other girls, and I all shared a room in Bundy. When I got inside, I saw Hannah rearranging the furniture in a way-too-small room for 6 girls. I remember being furious that Hannah and I had to share a room with 4 other girls on Bundy 1, where all of Ms. Prong's favorite varsity athletes lived. I thought there had to be some mistake. I went to the closet to put my stuff there and realized that I had left all my clothes somewhere else. I ran back to the dining hall to look for them. All the doors were locked and I remember looking in the windows and seeing everyone in there being gassed to death. I remember seeing my father and Albert slowly dying. For some reason this didn't bother me at all and I rushed back to my room to find all my roommates playing name games, even though we already all knew each other. My other roommates' names were Brianna, Susan, and Kaylee. I was so frustrated I didn't have clothes, so I borrowed some from Hannah. Then I did have to take exams and I woke up.",dream train different car different song play matter much like song play force next car really hot train wear bath suit train stop high school din hall go everyone study exam sit table friend bath suit ashley come behind olivia put lobster hair scream come another lobster run away finally get back table grabbed bag head back dorm way saw matthew david ignore frustrate parachuted yes parachute away scar olivia angry matthew david ignore get dorm realize begin school even though see everyone study final exam realize live anymore rush new dorm find sue tell hannah girl share room bundy get inside saw hannah rearrange furniture way small room girl remember furious hannah share room girl bundy prong favorite varsity athlete live thought mistake go closet put stuff realize leave clothes somewhere else run back din hall look door lock remember look window see everyone gas death remember see father albert slowly die reason bother rush back room find roommates play name game even though already know roommate name brianna susan kaylee frustrate clothes borrow hannah take exam wake,10.629296,6.5614367,410,7,4,5,3,4,4,2,6,10,5,0
4,bea1,Bea 1: a high school student,5,07/11/2003 (age 14),"So I dreamed that it was May again and everyone was playing Assassin as usual. Only the whole school was divided into houses like in Harry Potter, and only the Slytherins could kill the Gryffindors, and I was in Gryffindor and couldn't kill anyone. The only way you wouldn't be killed is if you were caught with $10 and your school ID. So I was walking down the main hallway and James Franco, who was in Slytherin, killed me. But then I showed him my ID card and $10. But for some reason this didn't matter to him, and he took my money and ID card. So then I went to the library and Anthony was there. He was in Gryffindor too and he studied there for exams since it was the end of the year again. We were also hiding from the Slytherins. They were like the High Inquisitorial Squad from Harry Potter too. Anthony and I were studying, but we had a question about math, so we went to find Mr. Stipps, who was in his office blow-drying sour milk out of his hair. He was really mad that we saw him blow-drying his hair and threatened not to give us any more DVDs or help if we continued to stand there. So Anthony and I left. I went to see Hannah and Sue in Bundy and Anthony went to Langton. When I got to Hannah's room, she told me that Mrs. Frank had called and wanted me to babysit her children the next evening. She said I shouldn't because the next evening was the dance. So I picked up the phone to call the Franks to tell them I couldn't babysit, but as soon as I went to dial the number, a woman's voice came over the receiver and said I couldn't dial. I ran to Sue's room to use her phone, but the woman's voice came over her phone too. So I then went to each room on the floor but all the lines were tapped. I finally went to the last room to dial before the woman figured out that I was using that phone. But I couldn't dial the number because all the numbers had been rearranged and I couldn't find the proper ones. I ran all the way down to Houk to use the phones there. But when I got there the whole building was on fire. Everyone was carrying furniture out of the burning dorm. It didn't occur to me that this was weird, people going back into a burning building. There was a plate of treats for everyone who carried furniture out of the building. I started to go back to Bundy, but my legs were so weak I could barely stand. I kept stumbling up to Bundy. When I reached the small parking lot between Langton and Slate, I saw Hannah's dad in a car and he nearly ran me over. I kept trying to get up to Bundy. When I finally got there though, Mrs. Frank and her two sons were all waiting for me. Apparently they were a day early. Mrs. Frank told me not to listen to Seth no matter what he said, and I was so confused I woke up.",dream may everyone play assassin usual whole school divide house like harry potter slytherins could kill gryffindors gryffindor kill anyone way kill caught school id walk main hallway james franco slytherin kill show id card reason matter take money id card go library anthony gryffindor study exam since end year also hide slytherins like high inquisitorial squad harry potter anthony study question math go find mr stipps office blow dry sour milk hair really mad saw blow dry hair threaten give u dvds help continue stand anthony leave go see hannah sue bundy anthony go langton get hannah room tell mr frank call want babysit child next even say next evening dance pick phone call frank tell babysit soon go dial number woman voice come receiver say dial ran sue room use phone woman voice come phone go room floor line tap finally go last room dial woman figure use phone dial number number rearrange find proper one run way houk use phone get whole building fire everyone carry furniture burn dorm occur weird people go back burn building plate treat everyone carry furniture build start go back bundy leg weak could barely stand keep stumble bundy reach small parking lot langton slate saw hannah dad car nearly run keep try get bundy finally get though mrs frank two son wait apparently day early mr frank tell listen seth matter say confuse wake,10.56959,6.5993824,560,5,2,4,6,3,5,2,6,8,13,0

We were cooking something and all of a sudden 100 male strippers jumped out and started stripping. It was really weird though because Alexis and I wanted to leave really badly so we started looking for the exit. The woman who directed the cooking show was mean and scary and wouldn't let us leave until we had shelved all the cans that were all over the ground. And then we had to organize them alphabetically. So we started. Then one of the guys came up to us and said he would let us out if we helped him make dinner. So we tried to help him make dinner, but we couldn't for some reason.

10,bea1,Bea 1: a high school student,11,07/17/2003 (age 14),"I had a dream that I was giving a tour of my high school. When I entered the chapel, it was pitch black and I could see nothing except for this little boy with a laptop. He jumped up to greet me and then launched into this discussion of wireless Internet on campus. He wanted to show me how it worked, so he turned some of the lights on really dim. I was shocked to see about 10 other people in the pews, all really old and like the boy with laptops. He went into all these programs and messed around on the computer until the lights shut off of their own accord, indicating that he was now connected to the Internet. I was surprised and impressed and had lost my tour. But it didn't bother me. I went downstairs to the mailroom to find everyone happy and excited, all carrying or eating candies and chocolates, all with roses and dressed in pink. They all said, ""Happy Valentines Day"" to me. I was surprised because I had no idea it was Valentines Day. It was really dark so I couldn't find my mailbox, yet I could see all my friends with their stuff. As I finally started opening my mailbox, Leah explained to me how much candy she had received and who had given her roses and such. I opened my box to find only 5 pieces of candy. Feeling rejected, I walked back upstairs where it was light again. I remember hearing this voice behind me calling my name, and I looked behind me to see Sam running toward me with one rose. He gave it to me and kissed my cheek before leaving. Puzzled, I went back to my dorm, where I fell asleep really quickly. I was woken late that night because the fire alarm rang. Hannah and I ran out of the room to a secret hallway I never new about before. We were all to wait there until a train picked us up to bring us to safety. So when the train finally came pirates who had stolen it controlled it. They kidnapped everyone but me. I had to run and hide in a nearby bathroom. When they came looking for me, I cut them with razors and sprayed their eyes with hairspray, and basically defeated them with beauty products (weird). Then I woke up.",dream give tour high school enter chapel pitch black could see nothing except little boy laptop jump greet launch discussion wireless internet campus want show work turn light really dim shock see people pews really old like boy laptop go program mess around computer light shut accord indicate connect internet surprise impress lose tour bother go downstairs mailroom find everyone happy excite carry eat candy chocolate rise dress pink say happy valentine day surprise idea valentine day really dark find mailbox yet could see friend stuff finally start open mailbox leah explain much candy receive give rise open box find piece candy feel reject walk back upstairs light remember hearing voice behind call name look behind see sam run toward one rise give kiss cheek leave puzzle go back dorm fell asleep really quickly wake late night fire alarm rang hannah run room secret hallway never new wait train pick u bring u safety train finally come pirate steal control kidnap everyone run hide nearby bathroom come look cut razor spray eye hairspray basically defeat beauty product weird wake,10.637691,6.5924854,402,3,6,4,5,5,7,6,8,14,10,0
11,bea1,Bea 1: a high school student,12,07/18/2003 (age 14),"I dreamed that I was in a bookstore with my family. My brother and I found books about Harry Potter by J.K. Rowling, but they weren't the real Harry Potter books. We got them anyway. When we were checking out, my mother found a bag containing more bags of jellybeans. She was asking the main who they belonged to. I wanted the jellybeans and quickly told her they were mind and that I had bought them earlier. When we returned to school, I went to Sophia and Sue's room. Sue, Alison, Hannah, Aidan, and Jayden were all there and we started trying to take Sophia's bed apart to find something. Everyone was positive that it was an antique, Chinese-made bed, and therefore I would be able to take it apart and put it back together. I started to remove the different wooden panels, but never found out what we were looking for and couldn't put the bed back together. Finally Jayden and Aidan found a piece of wood shaped like an elephant that held the whole bed together like some sort of puzzle. So then I went back to my bedroom at home and fell asleep. But then Jackson, who had climbed up the tree near the window by my bed and was asking me to come outside with him. I was scared and moved to my desk. But my computer had been swapped with someone else's, and I couldn't use this one. Then, somehow, Jackson took my bed to his room. Horrified, I grabbed on and was flying to his room on my bed. When I got there he began taking my bed apart so that I couldn't leave; however, I got away anyway. When I got back home, my computer was right where it was supposed to be. I signed onto AIM and promptly started talking to Bill about his sister's relationship with his best friend, Sam. Then Jon signed on and asked me for my phone number to call me. I gave it to him and literally within the next 30 seconds, the phone rang in real life and I debated getting up to pick it up or not.

But I didn't want to, so I dredged on through the mud. Then I saw Jayden and Aaron fishing for frogs. With them was Aidan. He asked me to prom, but I didn't even know that the prom was so close, so I just kept walking. I finally had come to the end of the swamp and there were the dorms. For some reason Bellah was following me for accepted students day or something. So I tried to find my dorm room, but it was completely impossible. Instead of the hallway with rooms was a HUGE ballroom and lots of small dark corridors. And I couldn't find my room! Finally after walking around forever, I found my room. Outside it was a stack of books and a balloon with my name on it. Bella and I went in but there was yet another huge room. In this one was a cooking show.

I became frustrated and then went down to Houk to find an alarm clock there; however, when I got near the School Archives at my high school, all the electricity went out. Everything just shut down. The only people from my trip I could find were Jayden and Aaron. We all walked past the Main Building. I think we were going to my house to see if the bus was there. Anyway, we eventually found the bus and started going to another private boarding school in a really small town similar to ours. When we got to the school, we all went to the locker rooms to shower. I accidentally went into the boys' showers and they all wanted me to join them. I guess I kind of wanted to, but I was scared so I went to the girls' showers.

I had 8th period four days in a row and on Wednesdays and Saturdays I had all the periods. It was horrible. In Spanish, Sra.

I had 2 double chemistry labs a week and it was just turning out to be the worst school year ever. Finally, I went to math one day and it was the same class I had freshman year, except it was in an English classroom. The big projector was down and all the lights were off. Everyone was having sex and Anthony and Lou were there and they wanted me to have sex. But I was scared, so I went home for Thanksgiving break. I was at Sue's house and I went through this door outside. I was on a big mountain. Lord Voldemort had returned and was eating Thanksgiving dinner with us. No one else knew it was him, and for some reason, I wasn't allowed to tell anyone else. On the mountain were Ron and Hermione, and Sue and I were throwing turkey to them to save everyone. But behind them were a lot of other bad people, so we were trying to get rid of them without hurting Ron and Hermione. Finally Ron and Hermione got up the mountain, and Lord Voldemort walked right by us. Sue understood and we both left because we were scared. We went to the lake because we had to try to take a boat back to my high school. So we started carrying out boats to the shore and ran into Mrs. Carter, who told us that my high school had moved to France. We ignored her and kept walking with our boats to the shore. We got into the water except we weren't in the boats. There were little kids in the boats and Isabel and I had to safely get them across the lake to my high school and away from Lord Voldemort.

16,bea1,Bea 1: a high school student,17,07/25/2003 (age 14),"I dreamed that I was sitting at one of the picnic benches at soccer camp and Aaron and I were discussing Anna Karenina and he had two of the characters mixed up or something and I was really frustrated with him because I knew I was right. I had the book and started to look it up. Just then my mother drove to pick me up and I left him. Then suddenly it was the first day of school. I was in the history wing and Ed was trying to show me something. He was pulling me somewhere and out of the middle of nowhere, Wyatt wanted to show me something different, so he began to pull me in the opposite direction. It was chaos because for some reason, it was also Parents Weekend. There were people everywhere. In the middle of everything, Gwenyth Paltrow was singing out of the blue. I was so exhausted; I finally went to my dorm. On the way, I met someone who gave me a pancake they wanted me to feed to the Maples' dog. I took a bite of the pancake and it was really good. When I was near the science building, the dog came out of nowhere and began to bite me. I was so angry and scared that I ran to my room in Houk. My room was completely deserted except for a queen-sized bed in the middle, the room with my Laura Ashley sheets on them. There was a secret passageway into my real room where Maria and Zoey were getting dressed. I realized that my clothes were too small, so I had to borrow some of Maria's hideous clothes. Andrea was there too. I finally went back to the main building only to realize that I had no schedule. I couldn't figure out what classes I had. I searched everywhere and went to my mailbox to find it.

17,bea1,Bea 1: a high school student,18,07/26/2003 (age 14),"I dreamed that I was spending some vacation with Gianna. She was living in this humungous house and her dad was really rich and worked for NASA. In one room there were a lot of beds all lined up against the wall. People were lying on the beds, and each had on a pair of shin guards. Underneath their shin guards were their stories and how they had been injured and why they were lying on these beds. Whenever Gianna or I lifted the shin guards to read the story, however, they woke up and started laughing at us. Then they made some sarcastic comment that was supposed to be satirical and making fun of a movie. Gianna and I realized that we were on the set of Scary Movie 3, and that's why everyone was making satirical comments. When we got to the last bed, a woman leapt out of nowhere and grabbed the shin guards away from us. She asked us if we had tried them on, and we said no. She then told us that it was a pair of deadly shin guards, and that whoever tried them on died the next day. Gianna and I went back to the main part of her house where a lot of maids were cleaning the tile floor. We started to watch a DVD before her dad came in and told us he had to leave again. Gianna was really upset. He got into this enormous truck and began to back out of the driveway before he began to fly and took off into the stars. Gianna and I went into another room where there was a fruit snacks factory. A large pipe would deposit fruit snacks into bags in short intervals. The pipe had been clogged and everyone was trying to fix it. Then this dream ended and I began another one where I was in Paris. Some friends and I were walking down a small street and spotted a good-looking cafe. We went inside and it turned out to be a sort of cafe/ice cream parlor/bakery/candy shop. We all went inside and tried to decide what to have. They had some of the weirdest candy, like ""Antique M&Ms;,"" where there was fruit inside the chocolate part. I went to go buy an ice cream cone, a coffee, and iced tea. I spilled the coffee as soon as I got it. Not wanting to pay for another. I filled it up with water and complained that they had given me water instead of coffee. They refilled it for me, and then I woke up.",dreamed spending vacation gianna live humungous house dad really rich work nasa one room lot bed line wall people lie bed pair shin guard underneath shin guard story injure lie bed whenever gianna lift shin guard read story however wake start laugh u make sarcastic comment suppose satirical make fun movie gianna realize set scary movie everyone make satirical comment get last bed woman leapt nowhere grab shin guard away u ask u try say tell u pair deadly shin guard whoever try die next day gianna go back main part house lot maid clean tile floor start watch dvd dad come tell u leave gianna really upset get enormous truck begin back driveway begin fly take star gianna go another room fruit snack factory large pipe would deposit fruit snack bag short interval pipe clog everyone try fix dream end begin another one paris friends walk small street spot good look cafe go inside turn sort cafe ice cream parlor bakery candy shop go inside try decide weird candy like antique fruit inside chocolate part go go buy ice cream cone coffee ice tea spill coffee soon get wanting pay another fill water complain give water instead coffee refill wake,10.670527,6.4860826,441,3,7,2,3,7,5,3,4,7,11,0

I saw someone who looked like him very much. It was his father. He told me that Anthony was nervous to be around me because he knew that I liked him and he liked me too. A few minutes later, Anthony appeared looking a bit surprised to see me. I asked him why we hadn't seen each other lately and he didn't answer me. He said he was going to get changed and we could go for a walk. We took a walk down to the English wing, trying to find comfortable chairs to sit in. We saw people in their English classes and for some reason this was weird because it was supposed to be summer or something. We got to the end of the English wing and saw that the chapel was dimly lit. We went inside and saw Faith playing the violin. She left immediately as soon as Anthony and I got there. But she left her metronome on. I went to turn it off. Built into the metronome was some sort of sprinkler; when I went to turn it off, I got soaked. I told Anthony I was going into the little chapel loft to get undressed/changed. I crawled up there and went to a pew in the back and began to peel off my soggy clothes. Then I saw Anthony's face near the staircase and he came up and helped me get out of my wet clothes. Then he kissed me and I woke up.

Valerie and I ran out of the house and into Mrs. Carter, who drove us to another house. Aidan and Jason were there and they saved Valerie and me.

Then, all of a sudden, everyone disappeared except for Aidan. We sort of started walking towards each other, and then he started crying! And then he disappeared too! I was so sad.

Kylie found this tiny object that was like a kaleidoscope in the shape of a rock. It was brightly colored and she let me look at it. I looked through it and was surprised to see pictures of Anthony, waving, smiling, playing, laughing, reading, etc. I realized that this was the graduation present his parents had given him that he had been waiting to open. I was furious with Kylie for stealing it. I called Anthony and we started chatting and laughing. I kept walking through the hallway to Post, where Anthony lived, but Kylie kept running after me. She wanted the kaleidoscope because she thought Anthony was cute and wanted an excuse to talk to him. I got really mad and tried talking to Anthony through post-it notes. It was really weird.

It was right in the beginning of the year, so everyone was really excited and energetic. I was sitting next to Gianna and we got called up on stage. When we got there, it started to shake uncontrollably, like some kind of trampoline. Everyone was laughing and cheering as we struggled to stay upright. We finally got off and walked inside Langton so I could go to the bathroom. I saw Lou and Ariana washing dishes. They had just seen my ""performance"" and were being really critical of it. Ariana said that when she saw me, she wanted to vomit. Lou laughed and then --to my horror --agreed. He was going out with Vanessa, and Ariana was discussing that now with Lou. I ran to the other end of the dorm and began to cry. I hated him for agreeing with Ariana, and I hated myself for liking him. On the opposite end of the hall was a movie theater. I went inside to watch Finding Nemo. There was a guy with flowers waiting for me; he was oddly reminiscent of Anthony. We began to chat and laugh, and soon Lou was out of my mind. When the movie was over, we walked out of Langton to find the campus deserted. We entered another dorm to find lots of people crammed inside. All the students were doing ridiculous chores and exercises as punishment from the teachers for having the huge concert. We ran out and into another dorm to avoid being caught and made to mow the grass with our teeth, or duel each other with umbrellas. We ran upstairs to my room. We could hear a teacher frantically pursuing us. I had the topmost loft as my room, only accessible by a leader, which unfortunately had been shattered. We tried in vain to climb up, but it was useless. We were caught and led downstairs where we were forced to drive metal pegs into the ground.

He spoke Spanish, so I said, ""Donde es el coche?"" (Where is your car?) But then I remembered that I had to use estar instead of ser. So I corrected myself and said ""Donde esta; el coche?"" A man nearby told me that the only way the little boy would find his way home is if I brought him to the church at the end of the mall at the rest area. I asked, ""Donde esta la iglesia?"" A woman told me she would lead me there. So I picked the little boy up and walked behind the woman. On the way I saw Ava; she had been shopping.

I couldn't position myself correctly because they would always skate away. Finally the game ended; we had won, and Chloe and Mrs. Carter were thrilled. Everyone then left and I was alone on the bench. Then all the lights went out. I began to take off my equipment right then and there. Doing so, I managed to lose my gloves, pants, and skates. When I finally had put what was remaining of my equipment into my bag, I assumed that my skates had somehow magically been transported to the locker room.

It was really dangerous. We had to cross 6 roads all next to each other to get to the school. The last 2 were these horribly steep and narrow staircases where people would skateboard. I was walking down them and the skateboarders couldn't see us. So I was especially scared. I finally got to my dorm and all my friends were going skating. They all left and I changed and put sunscreen on. Andrea and Camilia were there and they wanted to know if my boyfriends at my high school had made me any more comfortable with dating in college. I guess I kind of blew them off, because next thing I know, I am at the beach. It started to rain, so I had to go back to school. I was so sad when I looked at all these pictures of my high school friends and realized how much I missed them. I was in English with a lot of the freshmen, and Ms. Williams came in and announced we were having the school play that day. Everyone was really excited, except me, because it was a Tuesday, and Tuesdays were my best days, so I would have to miss my favorite classes. We had 30 minutes before we had to be in the auditorium. I went looking for my friends. Sue was giving a tour. Gianna and her brother were up in the math wing. I started walking to the dining hall.

I tried to run outside my house in the woods. He heard me and went back inside to get a flashlight for some reason. Then I ran up by the Links' house and Mr. Links came back with his flashlight. He found me, so I made a deal with him that if he stopped killing everyone else, he could kill me. It was so scary. Then I had a dream that we bought a new dog crate, not even a new dog, but just a new crate. It was a huge deal for some reason. I couldn't understand why everyone was so worked up, but whatever. So that ended and then I dreamed that it was exam time again at school. The new policy was that you could either take the exam in the classes you were taking, or you could pick up a new class and take that exam. So I decided to pick up dance and take that exam --it was a lot of fun! But ever since I had picked it up and had to dance with Julian, Lou stopped talking to me. It was unbearable and I couldn't understand why he was ignoring me. So for the exam, I had to have sex with Julian. I was really reluctant to do this, but I was guaranteed an A in the class and that I wouldn't even remember having sex with him, so I did. But the next morning, I was really sore and I did remember everything. Lou came up behind me and started flirting with me again, and I was so happy he wasn't ignoring me. I ran up to him and tried to hug him. Then he pushed me away, and I was really confused. I asked him what his problem was, and he said something to the effect of, ""At least I didn't sleep with someone to get a good grade. I don't want you sleeping with other boys.""

So I went back to Tudor England to get my books, returned to my dorm room, and then needed to go back to get my yearbook.

At the end, Lou got up to play a song (I was already over him) and he sang this beautiful love song to Marion. So that made me sort of sad, but I told myself I'd gotten over him anyway. And then Lance told me that it had actually been my name there in the song, but that Lou had changed it last minute because he didn't want me to know how he felt. So I decided to tell him instead. I knew he was in my brother's old room and the poor guy couldn't go to sleep because he was in there with some girl. I knocked on the door and said, ""Excuse me, you can't be in there and you need to come out now. We won't watch you come out, but you need to."" I was hoping that by hearing my voice, Lou would tell me he loved me. But instead he said, ""We'll get out as soon as you make us a hotel reservation and bring us some fiber pills."" At this, I thought my mother was in there because she takes fiber pills, so I wrenched the door open, and sure enough, Lou was lying there with my mother. Horrified, I slammed the door and started yelling, crying, and screaming. Lou didn't seem to care. I ran downstairs to get a phone book and threw it onto the bed yelling, ""Make your own stinking, dirty hotel reservation"" and all he did was laugh. I was so upset that I begged Sue to let me stay at her house. She was already having a sleepover with Hannah, so I slept in the living room. Mrs. Dunn made sure I had everything I wanted, and Mr. Dunn asked me about my college search. Sue had already gotten in somewhere, I think. The next morning we all went to Yuma, and I told them how everything was on sale. I bought a white bikini, and everyone else got shampoo and shoes. Olivia turned up later, back from Spain, but we didn't have any time to talk. Finally, I went home and on my computer was an IM chat from Tyler that said, ""I can't help myself, or you.""

First I was near the senior steps by the back of the dining hall, and my brother fell and landed with what I kept repeating in my head as ""a sickening crunch."" It was horrible. He had to be dead. Then I came home and my father had to fight these monsters working with Voldemort in the lake. He had a gun that looked like the remote control, and he got frustrated when I couldn't understand how it worked. I cut up his purple and white boxers to use as Clothies, because I didn't know when I'd see him again. My mother was tanning on the deck and I went inside the kitchen to be sad about my father leaving. I noticed the creamer standing outside the pantry. Slowly, it turned to face me. I got so scared. Fritz was evil and rabid and working with this creamer, trying to prove that my mother and I were anorexic. I ran upstairs because I was so scared. I went into my brother's room and jumped into his bed, nearly hysterical with fear, begging him to let me sleep there. My brother had this nail in his back, which I guess was serving as his stitches. The evil Fritz came in with the creamer and ripped the nail out of his back, and I screamed. Apparently, the nail was a family heirloom of Slytherin. There was also a cactus on my brother's bedside table, and it was a Horcrux that Voldemort used. He recovered because all of a sudden, he and Russell and Ted and I were all on the run from Voldemort. We were running around London and my high school, which was in London, trying to escape. We ran into my room and my roommate was Ron. Hector was chasing us too. He wanted to kill my baby, because apparently I was pregnant. We are running everywhere and Ginny started to slow down. I started freaking out, but saw this French marching band on the Spanish Steps (I guess we got to Rome somehow). The band members were all dressed in brightly colored robes and were supposed to help us, but they didn't. They just kept playing their instruments and waving their flags. We tried to save my mother and get back to school. Then I was supposed to go on a date with Pete. This was right after hockey practice, so I went to the bathroom to try and primp myself. For some reason, I wet my pants, but it didn't matter. I came out and Ian began pouring his heart out, telling me I was the only one for him, and that he loved me. But I was still so scared that I ran to my high school and burst into tears and I woke up crying.",last night bad dream life first near senior step back din hall brother fell land keep repeat head sicken crunch horrible dead come home father fight monster work voldemort lake gun look like remote control get frustrate understand work cut purple white boxer use clothies know see mother tan deck go inside kitchen sad father leave notice creamer stand outside pantry slowly turn face get scar fritz evil rabid work creamer try prove mother anorexic run upstairs scar go brother room jump bed nearly hysterical fear beg let sleep brother nail back guess serve stitch evil fritz come creamer rip nail back scream apparently nail family heirloom slytherin also cactus brother bedside table horcrux voldemort use recover sudden russell ted run voldemort run around london high school london try escape run room roommate ron hector chase u want kill baby apparently pregnant run everywhere ginny start slow start freak saw french march band spanish step guess get rome somehow band member dress brightly color robe suppose help u keep play instrument wave flag try save mother get back school suppose go date pete right hockey practice go bathroom try primp reason wet pant matter come ian begin pour heart tell one love still scar ran high school burst tear wake cry,10.644836,6.5850744,486,10,4,4,10,4,7,2,6,16,12,0

There was a live band there for some reason. Before I knew it, however, I was in New York babysitting this boy, Preston. He had myspace and 2 of his friends were coming over to play. But I couldn't find Preston. His friends arrived, a brown haired girl and a boy who looked much older than Preston. The boy was German and had an older brother my age. The brother was really cute and asked me to watch his brother for an hour or so. I gave up on Preston and watched the German boy instead. Finally the older brother came back after having coffee, and we all took the train back to my school's state. Then I went back to the city and was living in an apartment. Across the street Jennifer Garner taught 3rd grade. Ben Stiller was living with me and wanted to go to Jennifer's classroom. They met on the side of the street and she loved his poodle, Fluffy. They agreed to meet later for an ice cream. This train ran into my apartment and ruined everything. My mother and I were scrambling out. In the scuffle, we lost Fluffy, but we found Skye and Fritz, who were alive. We stepped onto the street and the cute German boy saw me. His mother thought I was Swedish. My brother was hanging around by the train wreck, and my father, my mother, and I all drove over to take him away.

And it was out towards Rio Villa, or Josie said it looked like we were going to Rio Villa. And when we got there, we didn't have to pay or anything; we just walked in. And we went up these stairs. Everything was in water up to our ankles. We were walking up this path and went up these stairs, and then we got in this pool and started swimming, and there were jets and vents, but I wasn't terribly concerned. And we walked, or we swam -- I swam right behind my father, who whistled once in a while to help me echo locate him , and we pulled into this part of the pool that was under an overhang, and it got closer and closer and closer. The sides got closer and closer together until I had to get out and just crawl on the side. I couldn't swim any more, they were so close together. And then I realized that in this echoing overhang they were playing a tape of scary sounds and I mixed it, without a mixer . How can you mix without a mixer?

The real song goes, ""Sally go round the sun, Sally go round the moon, Sally go round the chimney top every afternoon, boom!"" And the rendition, the variation in my dream goes, ""Cindy around the chimney, Susie around the sun, Cindy around the chimney, and then the work is done."" I can't explain that.

So I crawled under it and it was like a trampoline thing, and when I went in it, it was kind of low to the ground, and I wondered how am I going to get out of here. But when I realized what they were going to do, I was scared, and I thought to myself, ""I've got to get out of here somehow."" And then I asked my father, who was up above, I asked, ""Can I walk and down the walk while you guys do this?"" And he said, ""Sure."" So I wormed and squirmed my way out from under the truck. There was just enough room for me to squirm out from under it. And I realized that they were going to start up the engine and back it up a little bit, and then move it forward, so the result would be I would hear the back-up alarm and then hear the siren. So I figured I would walk as far away as I could and then be far way when that happened. So I took my bag -- I don't remember what I had in it at this time, but it will come to me, I'm sure. I took my bag and I went walking, and I walked, actually then I realized that the truck was parked in front of our house and I walked all the way up to 8th Street. And then I turned down 8th Street and went to 23rd Avenue and like went around a few blocks, and then I came back and they hadn't done it yet. And then I figured, ""I gotta get out of here somehow."" So I started crawling over all these boxes that suddenly appeared, and I started crawling faster and faster and faster as my father started -- I couldn't see him, but somehow I know that he was getting in the driver's seat and getting ready to start it up. And I crawled faster and faster and faster, and all of a sudden it started becoming dark and I faded into consciousness. One other important thing about this dream that I remember is that somewhere after that I had another little dream about the digital recorder that we were using, that it was part of the truck, and that I was worried that maybe the back-up alarm or something was integrated into it because it had like the click on the side of it that went ""drive, park, reverse"" and I was deathly afraid of putting it in reverse. But I did, I asked him and he said that wasn't the case, but they did, the gas fuel alarm thing on it. That was strange. But in real life it didn't have any of that on the side.

I started with the first line, ""Oh say, can you see, y puedes ver"" (sp??) and I was having a little trouble fitting, ""by the dawn's early light, con la loof temprana de amanese (sp???)"" into the melody. And I was really struggling with that. And later on there was something about Elizabeth driving the Mustang with somebody in it, but I don't remember for sure what that was about.

Then I went and I came into the auditorium and I sat down with four other people who were kind of in the auditorium; we were up in the balcony. And Mrs. Dougherty was kind of pacing around and talking to us, like she does, and kind of instructing the other people as to how they were supposed to stand and all when we went on stage, and then all of a sudden, in poured the class and they were noisier than anything. And they were just real loud and ruckussy in their sound filled the auditorium, and trying to get everybody quieted down, I don't remember exactly how. But we were supposed to be taking pictures for the yearbook, I guess, and everybody had to be in long pants and some kind of a shirt, which really didn't make a whole lot of sense, but that's how it was in my dream. And then Mrs. Dougherty was explaining how some of the boys were so fat that they couldn't even sit down in their chairs. And then I woke up and it was like 6:00. Then I went back to sleep and I had another dream. I dreamt, first of all, that I was in my bedroom and that it was daylight. And I had this bathtub full of Christmas decorations, which that's the place I was storing my presents for Christmas. But I was taking the bears out and putting them around, and this one bear I hung on the door, and it was this snoring musical bear where it had a three-way switch to just snore or just snore and play music too. And the other thing was this reindeer. It was just like the mechanical one that I used to have, only the mechanical one doesn't run any more. But in my dream the mechanical part didn't run, but for some reason it was playing 94.9 and it was sound, and that just made me go bananas in my dream.  I closed my door, I closed both of my doors so they latched in my dream, and [whispering] I kind of perched on the bed and then it was the bathtub that I perched on. It was so wild that I was kicking my legs around and stuff, and I was holding onto the railing. [regular voice again] Oh, that was another one of those embarrassing dreams. I hope nobody ever listens to this tape. And then when that wild episode was over, I came back into the bedroom from being in the bathtub, I came back into the bedroom, and there I found my mother on my bed snoring away, and I wondered how she got in there and what she saw.

And the big boys were okay; they were like, I always saw them in camouflage and they would go hunting and stuff and fishing in the woods and stuff. The little Sam was scary, though.

Okay, I can't remember any of the miscellaneous that were going on beforehand and some other little side dreams, but I do remember the main part. I dreamt that I had been practicing on the keyboard and I had it plugged in with an AC adapter to the extension cord under my dresser, and it was set up on top of its box on the bed so that I could stand up straight and sing, but still be able to see the keys like I did that one time when they were at the movies. And all the lights were off in the bedroom and I was talking to my mother in her work room. And I go in the bedroom and I turn the lights on, but for some reason, me turning on the lights powers up that extension cord underneath my dresser -- it doesn't really, but it did in my dream. And having power at that AC adapter powered up the keyboard, even though I didn't turn it on. And that familiar robot voice that greet us and I was like, ""Oh my gosh, you mean to tell me I didn't put it away?"" And so, and then it said, ""Select a song."" And then it starts playing this song because, see, in real life it can do this song demonstration thing, and when you activate it, it says, ""Select a song."" So we did that, but it started playing this song to demonstrate, but it was like a Celine Dion song from 94.1. That was kind of cool. And then my mother wanted me to teach her how to do some things and teach her about the notes of the staff and all, so I turn it off for a minute and I go to my desk and I draw a five-line staff and I start labeling the lines and spaces on scrap paper. And I'm ready to go back and give it to my mother and start teaching her, and next thing I know, she's back in her room sorting her papers and I missed my chance to teach her and show her. And then I woke up, and I was so mad when I woke up. I think I had this dream that I missed a chance to show her something because I don't want to be too stuck on a one-track mind. I've been thinking a lot about that lately, and I've been practicing on it every chance I get when there's nobody in the house. And I really am dying to show my mother some music theory and stuff, but I don't want to just, I'm so shy, and it's like when I bring this thing out and am practicing on it, I swear I'm never going to tell anybody.

And then I dreamt that my mother had a tape of the X Files that I made a CD of so she was getting rid of that tape, and I was thinking of saving it so I could recycle it, but I said naaah. Next I had another little dream, after I figured, I dreamt that I was so ice cold in my dream because the fan was making me cold, so I got up and turned it off. And I went back to sleep and dreamt I was at this fair thing with my mother, and there were these kids over in this one booth that she was watching while their mother went to go do something, and while we were in the bathroom, my mother told me she knew some stuff about Celine Dion, like her address and her phone number, but didn't want to tell any of us, and I guess because I knew who her baby doctor was, because she blabbed it all over TV.

We mostly just stayed at one end of the park and walked around and stuff. And then we met up with my father over at the petting zoo section and all the girls went on to do something else, and I was stopping and talking, and I was standing under the post of the fence of the petting zoo and I was talking and she said that there's this, he was glad we stayed on this side and all. And I was thinking, ""Yeah, of course she would be."" And there was this person that was going to do a concert show that was a guitarist from the '50's, and I didn't know the difference in my dream between a gunner and a guitarist, so I kind of thought that guns were like guitars and guitars were like guns.

And it was twirling around a little tiny bit. And I shut off the ignition just in time before it crashed into something. And oh, when I was on the interstate, I could see around me, everybody in the truck behind me. I could see my mother and Sandra in the truck behind me, and so when I got parked, shortly after that my mother pulled up in the truck.

And they were different colors like in the Dexter Hampton auditorium, but there was this big, wide open space down in front of the seats that they said for assemblies and stuff they set up a stage.

And it seemed that all the girls were taking a shower and Sam was reading, but I came downstairs and I thought I heard Sam playing the keyboard in the bedroom. And I know this is really stupid, but I'm going to have to say it anyway in order so that I can analyze my thoughts later. I dreamt that in order for the keyboard to work, we had to bake a cake, and there was this cake. And everybody would eat a piece of the cake, and when it was all gone, it wouldn't work any more. And I don't know what the connection was or why that happened like that, but it was weird. And it wasn't anything wild like he used to do. He was really sincerely trying to learn a song, and it was the Entertainer song that the ice cream truck plays all the time. And let's see, I dreamt that we also had a pineapple cake and a pear cake that I really wanted a piece of, but apparently my mother said they had containers that snapped shut and she couldn't get them open without making a whole bunch of noise. But she wanted to save them for when it was just us, so when I wanted a piece of cake, I had to have the other cake that made the thing work. That is so bizarre. How bizarre; how bizarre. And I also remember that later on I got my school schedule, and we had to whip up this like cake mix in order for my schedule to coincide.  And it was this like real powdery, awful-tasting cake mix we just had to whip up, and we had to spread it all over everywhere.  And I dreamt that I was going around on my first school schedule and that I stayed back and was talking and talking with Mrs. Dougherty with my mother, and that I missed Math completely, and there was an absence on my first day.

And Mrs. H.'s was bigger than life, and it was like almost poster size except it was just the head. And she had a blue background, like she had this beaver outfit on like she was this beaver on stage, and her hand was extending off to the side into the next picture. And her hand was extending like almost over the top of the Mrs. Dougherty picture, except you could still see her. It was just that the hand was in the way of the picture. And I dreamt that I was going to enlarge the other one and fix it up and get rid of Mrs. H.'s hand and all, so that hers would be bigger than life.

I don't know where this came from, but I did participate in a wedding and was the DJ, so maybe that's it. But anyway, I dreamt that our foyer was like four or five times as big as it really is, and I had my equipment set up and I was lining up CD's and getting ready because I had the notion that the prom people were going to just start filling up, coming in the house and filling up our foyer. And so I'm getting ready, getting techno stuff together and all, and next thing I know, my equipment won't work right and I have to have like a long time to like, I'm looking for this certain connector that I need and I can't find it.

And it was pouring down rain outside. And I think it was Elizabeth's cousin or brother-in-law -- some relative of hers that was kind of a young man in his 20s. And he was telling me about how he likes to play the trumpet. And I guess it was Thomas, because Thomas plays the trumpet. And he was saying how a keyboard is such a great thing because you can make it make all kinds of different sounds. And if you don't really play a certain instrument, but you want it in your song, you can make it make that sound if it's the right kind of synthesizer. And by this time I was like swinging on a swing, hanging from one of these stairwell things, and I think my mother comes in from the pouring rain and we go in that small little kitchen, and Elizabeth's asking about a mini disc. She thinks she wants to have something in the mini disc format.

388,jasmine2,Jasmine 2: high school,B-166,2002-09-03,"I had this dream, and it's 4:30 in the morning, and now I am wide awake.  But, oh well, this dream is quite interesting and encompasses a lot of different things. First I dreamt that I was in the bedroom and I was trying to set up a two-channel stereo system. Or no, I was trying to fix the speaker connection because they'd come undone. So I shut off the receiver and unplugged it just to be safe. And I was making the connections with the binding posts -- you know how that goes -- and I dreamt that in my dream we had a sub in the bedroom, which we don't. And that seemed to be alright; I didn't have to do anything like that. So I fixed the connections and then I turned the receiver back on and I was putting the speaker back in place, and the wires came undone. And I was real afraid to touch them because, of course, when the receiver's on they're carrying power and I knew not to touch them or I'd be shocked. And then I dreamt that my father was baking a mixer cake. By the way, this dream is going to probably take up the whole of this tape. I dreamt that my father was baking a mixer cake and it was really cool, and he was kind of joking, like he is, about ""Don't let my mother get all the cake,"" and stuff, and we were deciding on sizes for the cake by how many faders we have because we were cutting the cake with lines and we were cutting it according to, like we would say, ""I want four of these channel strips, so I want two of the shell (?) strips,"" and that would be how we'd know what sizes of the cake we want. Then I dreamt that I was writing these notes about how my life is being changed over the years, and I was writing these notes so that I could write this essay. And I was writing about the different phases that I went through, like first it was the toddler stage and then my animal magic show stage was 6-9, and I said that I had went through a real shy phase when I was little, which I really didn't, but in my dream I thought I had. And in all of this my father asked about the music major, and, of course, I hadn't said anything, I haven't said anything to him about it. So I just kind of said, like I just kind of like beat around the bush, I guess. And he asked about it more directly again, and I was kind of stunned. Well, actually, I wasn't really too, too stunned yet, and I just said, ""Oh, we found it like 20 years later and it needed work,"" or something like that. I then I stepped away to do something and he's baking another cake. Or I think then I come home from shopping with my mother, and there it is, sitting on the table, and all the flour and all the mess. And it's like sitting there in all its glory, and I'm like stunned.  But the thing of it is, my father thinks he can connect the mixer cake to it.  And it was hilarious because it's not even a real mixer he's trying to connect to it. And I know for a fact that it didn't have any a______ or audio out, but I was able to microphone it and record it through my mixer.  Here he is, trying to connect a mixer cake to it. And I'm like, he's having my mother and I help him like move stuff, and I'm like grabbing my mother's wrist and like doing the intermittent grip signal, like, ""Oh my gosh, what in the world is happening here?"" And I hated to see it in all the flour and all the mess, but everybody was trying to connect it to a real mixer. Oooohhhhhh! But, and then, I had one more part to this dream. I guess you could see why I'm wide awake! Then we were in Cash and Carry and we were looking at Easter bunnies, and over in the Easter Department we were looking at Easter bunnies and I was dancing to this disco music under this strobe light.  I guess I meant what I said in my song when I said, ""When I run through the pastures of my slumber, you're never out of sight."" I feel I need to add to this that I didn't really feel was important, but now I see it could have some meaning. I dreamt that I was wearing a tee-shirt with a picture of it on it, almost like the tree bird shirt, only it wasn't. It was the color of the tree bird shirt and it had a picture of it on it, only I was walking through Cash and Carry. And I think maybe this could mean that some day -- how should I say it -- I think that I mean to say that some day I'll be brave enough and confident enough to tell the world its story and wear it openly on my heart instead of hidden the way it is now. And I don't know -- I just [sigh], I've just still got this shy thing going on, I don't know.",dream morning wide awake oh well dream quite interesting encompasses lot different thing first dream bedroom try set two channel stereo system try fix speaker connection come undone shut receiver unplug safe make connection bind post know go dreamt dream sub bedroom seem alright anything like fix connection turn receiver back put speaker back place wire come undone real afraid touch course receiver carry power know touch shock dreamt father bake mixer cake way dream go probably take whole tape dreamt father bake mixer cake really cool kind joke like let mother get cake stuff decide size cake many faders cut cake line cut accord like would say want four channel strip want two shell strip would know size cake want dreamt write note life change year write note could write essay write different phase go like first toddler stage animal magic show stage say go real shy phase little really dream thought father ask music major course say anything say anything kind say like kind like beat around bush guess ask directly kind stun well actually really stunned yet say oh find like year later need work something like step away something bake another cake think come home shopping mother sit table flour mess like sit glory like stunned thing father think connect mixer cake hilarious even real mixer try connect know fact audio able microphone record mixer try connect mixer cake like mother help like move stuff like grab mother wrist like intermittent grip signal like oh gosh world happen hat see flour mess everybody try connect real mixer oooohhhhhh one part dream guess could see wide awake cash carry look easter bunny easter department look easter bunny dance disco music strobe light guess mean say song say run pasture slumber never sight feel need add really feel important see could mean dreamt wear tee shirt picture almost like tree bird shirt color tree bird shirt picture walk cash carry think maybe could mean day say think mean say day brave enough confident enough tell world story wear openly heart instead hidden way know sigh still get shy thing go know,5.2767143,11.083131,940,4,6,3,6,11,4,6,17,8,17,0

Space is of a premium here. I had quite a dream last night. I dreamt that Mrs. Dougherty and I were in the little theater and first we were just standing and talking, and then we were sitting down in chairs next to each other. And next I was sitting on her lap, like my mother and I sit sometimes when she says, ""You big baby."" And we were talking about like how the altos have the tendency to want to be more riled up and more street-like than the sopranos do. And then we were in the auditorium, and I was standing up on the stage and watching all of them coming up on the stage, and it was real clear this morning -- the rest of it. But the tape rain out and I didn't have enough room and I was going to do it on another tape but I didn't have time in the morning; it was like 8:00 o'clock already. But now it's all kind of like vague and foggy. I should have put it on first thing, as soon as I woke up.

And, you know, I think they were all, I don't remember Lucy and Robert or Arlene being there. But anyway, most of them were there. And I even think Ms. Fayne was there and Aunt Janice was in this blue dress. We were all sitting in the living room and this house had like a white tile concrete floor and it looked like a typical modern house. And I didn't know whose house it was, but it was one of their houses. And whoever's house it was, but there was this side room like a dining room almost, except there was no dining table. There was a keyboard in there too, and we were all sitting out in the main room talking, and there was this dog that was running around. And then we decided we would all move into the side room for some reason and the keyboard was by this time kind of in the way, kind of half blocking the doorway and they were kind of worried that I was going to knock it over. But, of course, I just kind of stood there and like stared for a minute at it, and Mr. Fayne told me not to touch it because she had no idea what it was going to do or sound like. So we all sat down on this little couch thing and we started talking. There were chairs and a couch in this room, and we like resumed our conversation. And Aunt Janice goes over and turns this thing on and starts ""practicing,"" except there's only one problem -- it doesn't work really, and she's like practicing away and moving her fingers all around, but there's no sound. There's only a tap, tap, tap, tap. And it's like, what in the world? I guess we know where that came from. And then I woke up and I went back to sleep and I dreamt, I kind of like resumed the dream. I dreamt that we were still in the same house and that I had to get my mother's boom box out of the attic. This house was like some modern house downstairs, but it was our upstairs. So I got my mother's boom box out of the attic, and somehow I had the notion that the people's keyboard wouldn't work because the record key on my mother's boom box was broken off. So I was like trying to fix it, but I think ""record"" and ""play"" were like attached together somehow and I was trying to figure how to attach it back on so that I could record somebody saying something with the boom box. And I attached it the wrong way first, so I had to like take it off and reattach it. And, you know, that's all I remember at this time. What a shame! I should have done this when I first woke up.

And there was like, I told them I'm usually very leery of red things because red represents seeing an alarm, but this time it was green for some reason. So we got into English class and we were kind of sitting there listening to this college rep guy advertising I think he was talking about USC and how great it is and how great their scholarships are, and, ""If you drop out, we'll hold your scholarship for ten years and if you come back, we'll still give it back to you."" And I was r_____ there and I was looking through this book he gave me, and while I was -- well, this is the funny part -- while I was sitting there looking at this book of scholarship stuff, I started to get a little nervous and a little afraid because I was thinking of the song I was singing to the baby and I was also thinking about how we were calling ourselves Mamaloo, Papaloo, Babyloo, Chickenloo and Roosterloo.

And the towel was like real pretty with like stars and seashells and glittery stuff on it. And I lifted the towel, and it was this talking, singing teddy bear, and he had a keyboard on his lap. And he would like sing songs and play it, and like do like little kids things and stuff. And so anyway, I really thought he was cool and I wanted to keep him for like when we were babysitting. But then when I went to cover him back up with the towel, so nobody would see him, the towel was totally missing. The towel was gone. And I couldn't find it anywhere. It was like it was part of the chair, it was part of the thing. I told you, it was real fancy. And then, since I couldn't find the towel, I sat him in this basket and covered him up with an ordinary towel. And I came in the house for a second -- let me think for a minute -- I think my father had the TV on and there was one of those parades of things that I used to make when I was real little going around on the floor. And I can't remember what I was doing or where I went or why I went in the house, but I was thinking, ""I have to go out to the picnic table to where I was cleaning out and bring the teddy bear before somebody throws it out because it's disguised as some other thing.

And so she kind of got out of the tree and walked over there and saw that it was Mr. Girard's class over there, which really this was switched around because our class should have been doing the singing and his class should have been doing the acting.

And so they had flabbing toilets and flabbing sinks in the boys' bathroom at school. So I had to run past that. Then I had to run through a really vulnerable area where the fire alarms would go off at any moment. And I finally got over to in front of the cafeteria where they waiting for me, and somehow I had the notion that a few feet away from us was the boys' bathroom that had flabbing toilets and sinks.

And it was 4:00 and my mother kept diddling and diddling and diddling and diddling and diddling and we didn't get out 'til 4:30. But when we got out, I learned that the plans had changed and it wasn't Gloria Esteban, it was Bette Midler and she was coming to our yard. So we were setting up chairs and tables and stuff for people, and she was going to stand in the garage and sing. And then amongst all this I realized she is going to need some audio reinforcement. So we got out the Peavey system and my father was going to play the drums. So he had his drums at his table and I had my mixer at my table, and we were ran the wires and I think we might a microphone by my father's drums and I ran them into the Peavey board. And, of course, hers. But hers was the far right like it was the master, her fader. And she started singing, and I had to just do it on the fly without a sound check, so I had to guess at the levels and then quickly readjust them as the concert started. And then, in amongst all of this, I realized that all of a sudden we were in an auditorium and I was singing kind of like on a side close to the stage, and I didn't have a mixer, but I had my mini disc recorder and I was recording the whole thing. And she was singing the song, ""Prayer"" by Celine Dion and she was like swirling and spinning through the aisles and I got to see her. And then I dreamt that the lights came up in the auditorium and she was introducing that she was an ID vocal teacher at the school, and that she was going to let some of our ID students perform. And then I woke up. Oh, but no, not yet. I kind of woke up, and I took a look around and then I went back to sleep, and I dreamt that we were going shopping.

That was crazy.  And so we got in there and, first of all, the concert was nothing like I expected it to be, and second of all, there was this lady who, I was taking out my jar of gravel and looking at the side to see how high up the jar it was, and the lady said she didn't want that in there, she didn't want me fiddling around with that during the concert.

I had a notion that it was the Rosses that were hosting it, but I didn't know who was hosting it. And there were like these tables around with these snack things. There were like two or three bowls of snacks at each table. And there was a pool at this house. And there was like this man. We were on the second floor and we were on a balcony overlooking the pool and this man was like giving us very specific instructions about how to open bags of snacks and serve them, and when to put more out and when to leave the bowls empty, and not to put too much out. And on further analysis, I think this man must have been Mace, Barbara's husband, because when they sent us our invitation, they gave us real specific instructions as to when to come, where to park, don't bring a gift, and please let other people sit down and eat when you're done, and all kinds of stuff like that. So I think that's where that came from. Also something very strange -- the past two times I have dreamt about hearing the ""Wee Sing"" tape, I've been really, really scared and wanting to cling to my mother when ""Blue Bird"" is about to come on. I stopped having dreams like that a while ago, and whenever I would dream about the tape, it wouldn't be scary. But now I'm starting to be scared when I have those dreams, but not when I wake up, just in the dream. So I dreamt that all of a sudden we were in this bedroom at the house and the tape was playing and ""London Bridge"" was on, and my mother was going to do something, she was going to fill up more bowls of snacks. And ""Blue Bird"" came on and I just clung to her and I was like, ""Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God"" and I was ready to start crying and things. And then I slowly faded into consciousness and I woke up. I don't know what all that's about. But at least the good news is, is I don't wake up really scared like I used to.

And then Uncle Fred told my mother and my father what I really wanted. Next thing I knew, it was set up on a little tray like my typing keyboard is in my studio. Well, it was set up on a little tray in the TV cabinet in the living room, between the TV and the amplifier. And when my father and I were sitting there listening to Celine Dion, I got up from the couch and moved the computer chair over in front of the TV cabinet and I pulled out that little tray, and we were hearing this the way it is, and I was trying to play it along with the CD, which I think it was a horrible job, but I don't know. It was just a dream anyway. And then I stood up and I was going over to my father to ask him how he thought I did. He was sound asleep. He was snoring away, which I thought it was pretty good because I really didn't want him to see me and hear my anyway.  Then the next time I sat down was when nobody was in the house, and I thought, ""Okay, I am going to sit down and practice and do a decent job this time."" And I sat down and turned it on and it was not connected to the amplifier any more, so I sat down and started checking it out. The amplifier was as light as a feather, so I just lifted it off the shelf and turned it around and looked at the back of it, and it was nothing like I'm used to seeing when I'm conscious. There were no RCA (?) connections whatsoever. It looked more like the back of the car radio, which is probably because that's what we were kind of doing like a few days ago. And I was trying to find a way to kind of jam some bare wire into some connection so that I could get this connection made and get this thing connected to the amplifier again. And just as I was doing that, I heard my mother and my father coming home in the car and I had wires and connections and stuff all over the living room. And I didn't want them to see that I had been messing around, so I met my father at the door and said, ""You can't come in right now, I'm working on a surprise."" And he said, ""Well, just guide me in, I'll close my eyes."" And then I woke up, realized it was all a dream and said he can come in if he wants to.

And it was the soundtrack to a musical where Celine Dion was the main girl in it, and it was done kind of like in opera except it was sung with regular voices and not operatic voices. And here's how the story line basically went: there was this girl who lived in this big house and she was sick and tired of being a servant. And that's the girl that Celine Dion played. And her two sisters were kind of competing to marry this rich guy, and one of the sisters died and one of the sisters found somebody else.

430,jasmine2,Jasmine 2: high school,B-208,2002-12-30,"Last night I had a dream that we were having some people over, and this girl who was sitting next to me -- oh no, it wasn't just one girl, it was three or four kids my own age who wanted me to show them my sound equipment. Oh, I know what it was now! I had set up, well, first of all, I dreamt that all of my sound equipment resided on the computer desk downstairs and that the PC was really the Mac that ran this little performer, and it was all down there. And I had set it up in just a certain way, and there were these three or four people who wanted to see it, how it worked. And all of a sudden the three or four people dwindled down to one girl, and so I explained the difference between the two mixers -- the Peavey and the tascam -- but in my dream they were both black. Then this girl turns on the computer and she's waiting for it to start up, and she doesn't see a desktop right away and she gets a little alarmed, like, ""Hey! Where does this reside in the..."" and then she was like, ""This program, Digital Performer you're talking about, where does it reside?"" And I was like, ""Just be patient; it will come up."" And so when it came up, the desktop was green and I showed her the icon as to where to go and stuff, and I don't remember too much about what she saw when she got in the program or what her reaction to it was. But I do remember all of a sudden there were a ton of people, like Uncle Carl and Aunt Joyce and a bunch of other family people and a bunch of the Fire Department people. And all of a sudden they wanted me to sing for them, so I go up and I start warming up. Now, you know that when I set up my equipment, I know at least a day in advance so I have a whole half an hour to set it up, to get ready to be amplified on the system. Well, I just wanted to have some accompaniment this time, and I had some stuff started on the CD RW, but my CD recorder is the only one that'll play CD RW's, so I was really in a rock and a hard place because what I was fixing to do was record it onto a tape and play the tape on my mother's boom box while I sang along and not involve the sound system this time, which is what I did, and I came downstairs with the boom box and I set it up, and all the people were gone. There was only like one person and my father in the living room. And my father was like, ""You'd better go out there and yell to them. They're all in their cars."" And so I went out there, and I yelled, ""Hey, you guys!"" And they were all gone. But the bird was just going nuts, screeching and screeching and screeching. So I yelled at him, I was going, ""Hey, Archie, stop!"" And at that point some car honked its horn. It had a really funny sound to it. And then I went back inside, and I figured, ""Well, that's a wash. That was a lot of work for nothing."" And even the girl was gone, who was supposedly looking at Digital Performer. And so I went upstairs and I was arranging some stuff back to the way it was, and I realized that I had left the sub on from the last time I had the sound system on, and you know how they require more power and so they have their own amplifiers. So you gotta click the switch on and off, so I forgot to click the switch off and I could hear that it had a little bit of chubba chubba chubba chubba sound, which meant there was an internal cooling fan cooling it off. And so I figured I'll shut it off so it'll quit getting hot and it'll cool itself off. So I reach down, I clicked the switch off, but when I did that, its fan like kicked in full force and it blew all this warm air out at me, and I was like so spooked by that and I ran out of my studio with a yell! And that was funny! And I was still spooked and I jumped up on my bed, and I set my hand down and there was a moth ball under my covers, but I got so scared, I thought it was either a mouse or something. So I screamed again.  And my father was like, ""Are you alright?"" And then I woke up.

And he turns around and he throws it back at us, but he doesn't hit us, fortunately.  That was weird. And this is the most startling and weird part of all. It wasn't scary, but it was weird. It was disappointing. I dreamt that my mother's Bose wave radio CD and her boom box both needed batteries to run. Her Bose thing needed AA's and the boom box needed C's, like it's always needed. And I dreamt that they were both prone to falling out of the machine, and with both machines, if the batteries would fall out while the machine is playing, it would start making this, ""Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo"" sound instead of your audio. And you'd think if it would still have enough power to make that sound, you'd think it would have enough power to keep playing your audio, but no!

He was really doing a lot of stuff with the City, but I dreamt that he was training these actors and actresses and he was part of the scenery. And I was asking him about what he does, and he didn't want to tell because he said he's sworn to secrecy and he doesn't want the word to get out. And I was thinking, ""Man, that's a show that I really like, and I never knew that my father was part of it until now?"" And let's see, I know there was something else. And we were taking this walk, and he was kind of telling me something. And we were with Clark and Marylou and a couple other people. And I think I was in a hurry to get home because I knew Mrs. Dougherty was coming over, so then I tell him I'm going to break away from the crowd and I start running. And I'm almost home, and then I woke up. [I dreamt that Mom and I, when I was sight reading, that we kept getting interrupted because the first time I tested it out, it took me a while to hem and haw and get over the heebie jeebies and stuff, and finally admit to myself that it's okay to be a little kind of cheesy and all, and so, but that day when I was doing that for the first time back in June, Mom and my father had gone, were going to go to a movie, which they did, but my father left to go do an errand real quick. And Mom thought that she was too late and that he had left for the theater without her, and so she got on her bike and rode down to the theater. And then my father came home and wondered where she went and I told him that she had gone to the theater, and so they said that they would meet up. So then when he left, I was reasonably sure that it was safe, and I took it out after some hemming and hawing and all that, and it was sitting on its -- oh, I get so tongue-tied! -- anyway, it was sitting on the bed in all its glory when first the phone rings. It's Mom calling from a pay phone to say that she hadn't seen my father yet. Then I hang up the phone and I go back to what I'm doing, and then the phone rings again like two minutes later, and it's my father to say that he met up with Mom. So then I go back to my business, and while I'm talking on the phone, I'm just hoping that nobody's going to come to the door.  And let's see, oh yeah, and then I go back to business, and then Christian calls! And I'm like, ""Jiminy Christmas, when are these phone calls going to leave me alone!?""  And another funny thing that happened is I took care of that and I set it aside. I put it back in its box and I went to set up the sound system for my father's party that was going to happen that night, and I was done, and so I figured, ""Well, I've got an extra hour before they're supposed to come home. I can go learn some more songs."" And so I took it out again, I set it up, and so I'm learning, ""My Heart Will Go On"" by ear, and I'm chipping and chipping away at way, screwing up here and messing up there, making a terrible total mess of it, but having fun. And next thing I know, what do I hear but the truck, and remember how those keys to turn it on and off are so difficult, and you can't do it with the wrong kind of touch. You can't do it with nervous fingers. And, of course, I was like, ""Ahhhhhh, oh, my gosh!"" And I finally was able to turn it off and saw the LED's go dark, and I shoved it back in its box so fast, and I shoved the box back in its corner. I raced down to meet them, trying to be as calm as I can -- that was some ordeal! But, you know, Mom found out anyway because, first of all, I couldn't keep it from her too long. You know, I tell her everything. And second of all, the box is right by the phone and so when I put the box back, it sat on top of the phone cord, and she knew that I'd been handling it.]",dreamt father one people trained people american dream really lot stuff city dreamt train actor actress part scenery ask want tell say swear secrecy want word get think man show really like never know father part let see know something else take walk kind tell something clark marylou couple people think hurry get home knew mrs dougherty come tell go break away crowd start run almost home wake dreamt mom sight read keep get interrupt first time test take hem haw get heebie jeebies stuff finally admit okay little kind cheesy day first time back june mom father go go go movie father leave go errand real quick mom think late leave theater without get bike rode theater father come home wonder go tell go theater say would meet left reasonably sure safe take hem haw sit oh get tongue tie anyway sit bed glory first phone ring mom call pay phone say see father yet hang phone go back phone ring like two minute later father say met mom go back business talk phone hop nobody go come door let see oh yeah go back business christian call like jiminy christmas phone call go leave alone another funny thing happen take care set aside put back box go set sound system father party go happen night figure well get extra hour suppose come home go learn song take set learn heart go ear chip chip away way screw mess make terrible total mess fun next thing know hear truck remember key turn difficult wrong kind touch nervous finger course like ahhhhhh oh gosh finally able turn saw lead go dark shove back box fast shove box back corner race meet try calm ordeal know mom find anyway first keep long know tell everything second box right phone put box back sat top phone cord know handle,5.3383403,11.134791,822,2,15,3,3,7,5,5,16,9,16,0

We were staying in this little hotel that had a view of the track, and there was this guy who was probably a veteran. He organized veteran parades that were little things that took ten minutes, and they ran by like every hour. And when they ran by, there was these rescue trucks with these sirens. Some made the standard warble sound, some made the back-up alarm sound, like that interval, and some just made a plain wail sound. And all these going by. Some honked their horns, some didn't. It made a big ruckus and it scared me really bad. And I was laying down in the bed at the hotel and I think my mother was there doing something, and I hear this and it was like totally commotiony. And then we were down there before the actual Festival of States parade was going to take place, and Sandra was there and my mother. I think my father was there, but he was off helping one of the rescue guys. But anyway, there was this extra long parade by this veteran guy before the actual Festive of States parade started, and I figured, ""Ooh, boy, I'd better get myself out of here."" And so I said I had to use the bathroom, and I went into the hotel's bathroom and I was sitting there and sitting there and sitting there on the toilet, listening to these girls trying on clown dresses and commenting on how they looked.

And the poem read for those lines, ""And the monster of the water came up and bit off a piece of her head."" And that was real weird, and she was like freaking out because she was so scared of this monster. And I can remember that I kind of like, they were talking about the monster of the water all through this poem, but the last line said something about the monster of Oof. That was weird.

I dreamt that in English we were reading in our literature book and we were reading this story about this man who was like obsessed. And he was obsessed with people knowing where they are and people feeling safe, but yet he did these things that really wouldn't make them, or really wouldn't make me feel any safer, like, for example, he wanted to put a little alarm thing that kind of sounded like back-up alarms near people's houses so that they would always know where they are. Well, for me that would be just awful. And he wanted to wait until they were sleeping so they couldn't say anything, and he needed a cool, breezy night to do it. And I think what he was going to do was tap into their plumbing pipes and stick it in lines and that when they turn on their water, the water would go through and activate it. And then he was also wanting to put them in elevators so that if people get stuck, they could make enough racket and be heard. Well, and then we finished the story, and we were starting to look at it and questions. Oh, and I walked out of English class with this girl named Marilla who I have, that sits next to me with my internship seminars. But here she was in my English class and I walked out with her. We were going down the stairs and there, set up on the landing of the stairwell, was a little sound booth, recording studio-like type thing. And Elizabeth and this boy sat down and they were listening to this tape of this band that was playing, and the monitors were facing us because there were microphones and they didn't want them to fade. And I went over there and sometimes I have a bad habit of using -- not necessarily a bad habit, but I have a habit of using two fingers to move faders instead of one, because when I want to move them in small increments I just two fingers. I went over there and I adjusted some of the faders and Elizabeth kind of was surprised at my two finger grip and she said, ""Why don't you just use one finger?"" And I was like, ""Because two fingers is more precise for me.""

And then I said that, well, if people want Hersey kisses, how will they know to ask us? If they're not on the table, they won't want to bother us for them.

481,jasmine2,Jasmine 2: high school,B-261,2003-04-15,"Last night I had an absurd dream, and the tape is probably going to flip any minute, so beware. I dreamt that I was at Ace Field on a Saturday and Frederick was showing me this hand-held, real heavy device that reminded me of, it was about the size of the talking calculator, but it was a little heavier. It was some kind of audio editing device, and it was kind of a bluish color and it had a real wide LCD display. And it had a few keys along the bottom and a few up the side. And Frederick was seeing that the labels were unusually large and they could actually see all of them. And he wanted to make sure I could see all of them by asking me where to find the keys that went up or down, the volume ____. And I found them like in the bottom right area, and I upped the CD about three or four notches. And then I realized that in order to edit audio and put programs together, that I had to have these -- what's the material? -- I had to have these clay alphabet letter blocks, and a lot of them were attached together vertically in a column, and some were loose. And I didn't know what I had to do with these alphabet letter blocks, but I had a feeling it was like making a story board for a movie. And there was also this book that was like the length of a novel that went with it. And Frederick was going to try to teach me a few things so that I could make an order, because I had a notion that I was having a party that evening and I was going to make a border for the playlist for the party. And then we like ran out of time and he let me just take the thing home and learn some stuff on my own and show it to him on Monday, because he realized we weren't going to have any more time before the party. I remember looking at the time and it was 4:50 and I had to get home because the party was at 6:00. So then I make my way to the front and up the, I mean down the elevator, and I realize that I'm at Sycamore Gardens and I ask the lady at the front to use the phone because I dug in my purse and I didn't have the cell phone. And her phone was like whacko. It was like you would pick it up and instead of a dial tone, there was this commercial for like Spanish food, and you had to actually push a number before it would have a thing. And so first I dialed 566-8554 and realized that wasn't the one, so put it down and tried again. And then I dialed our land line and I don't think I got through. Before I finished, I hung up and there was, so I'm going to say that before I could get through, my mother came and picked me up, which was good, so I didn't have to call. She picked me up in the parking lot, and instead of the car, she had the blue car that was like all beat up and these broken windows and this yuckiness, and I kind of was a little startled, I was like, ""Where did you get this?"" and she was like, ""It's Joan's."" And she said that it was a special model that was made to look like this to show that it had been through the war. And I was like, ""What?!""

And this evangelist girl, kind of like a Spanish descent, real nice and real sweet, was in my mother's work room talking to this black street kid who was like, the black kid was like this big momma, like Missy Elliot just sitting there, and she was so mean and so harsh that the evangelist girl was trying to convert her and make her softer, but it didn't work. So they both ran out of the house, and then I remembered I was going to the Dome, and so I got there and I didn't know whose equipment was going to be set up or when, and I went up the stairs, and, of course, my father was like following me the whole time. For some reason the gates were locked and we had to get somebody to open them up and let us in. And we went up the stairs and, to my relief, the guys were there setting up their equipment, and I had my cane for whatever reason, and I actually like bumped into a pole.  So they set up the equipment -- the board and the CD players -- and they connected one of the CD players by way of RCA connectors, but they left the other one undone for who knows what reason. And I was trying to connect it, but for some reason I had the notion that the RCA connectors would carry all the power from like the power mixer. And so my father was like, ""You don't have to turn the power off,"" but I didn't want to touch the actual receptacle. It was like I was trying to connect the speaker jacks while the unit was on, but it wasn't; it was just the line level, but I thought that it wasn't, so I was real, real cautious.

Here's what it was: I dreamt that I had to go to Grad Night that evening, which really is what is today, but before I went to Grad Night, my father put this responsibility on me that I had to prepare this little pizza thing in the fry pan, and I also had to turn on the air conditioner. And how you would do it is you would light a torch and you would kinda light the air conditioner with a torch, and the air conditioner, we called it the Hossle (?), so I had to take this torch -- believe it or not -- the plastic end (?) -- this gets sillier! There was this prize that I won from a raffle that was a little pocket torch keychain, like a cigarette lighter, except when you turn it on, it smells like a torch. And they called it a portable cruise torch. So I was using this portable cruise torch to light the Hossle and so I think I had to like turn it on and I got it near the air conditioner and it didn't light. It was starting to get out of control and so I threw it in the water to put it out, but it wouldn't go in the water. I ended up shoving it into the side of the blue cabinets, flame and all, then there was a towel close by and then I realized that it might burn things. So I took it and it got stuck like a magnet there. I had to like pull it off. And I threw it outside and I never did get the Hossle air conditioner lit, and I know there was more.

And then I was like really scared because I thought I was stuck up there, and then I realized all I had to do was press 1 and it would start coming down again, which was exactly what it did. And another thing -- kind of later when I was outside -- I was walking down the hall and these two, this guy and this girl were talking about something juicy about their relationship, I guess, and they were like kinda singing and kinda talking, and I kind of thought they might be fighting even. And I was trying to follow them and hear what they were saying, and I followed them into this classroom and I sat down kind of in the back of a row and it was real noisy and stuff.

487,jasmine2,Jasmine 2: high school,B-267,2003-05-12,"Two days ago I slept in Grady House when we were at hot springs and I had the dumbest, silliest, stupidest dream -- you would not believe! First of all, I dreamt that I was at school and it was kind of like one of my last dreams and we weren't doing much in class. And we were all kind of hanging out and partying and having assemblies and stuff, and there was this show, movie-like type thing that I was going to go and see in the auditorium with my mother. It was going to be a combination of Celine Dion and a few other people singing and doing things and stuff. And one of the officiants in the VE specialist office -- I can't remember her name -- but it was Mrs. Bernard or somebody -- was going to show me a shorter way to get there. And she said that I had to go through the Teacher's Lounge and through some teachers' special areas that no other students could go. Well, when I started going through that area with her, it was like a long hallway and a tunnel and several twists and several little office areas to go through, and there was this sound system that was very quiet, but audible, and very keen and very thin and very blah -- no frequency band width to it whatsoever. And so, of course, just like the Dome, it was mixed with this ""buzzzzzzzzzz"" sound, and as you were walking through this hallway, you would hear the sound coming, there would be the speakers mounted -- some on the ceiling, some on the walls kinda of close to my waist height, and some on the floor. And you would be walking by and any time you would get near one of them, and you could feel the sound waves. It would just give your muscles these sensations, these shaky, jittery sensations and you'd like fall down and stuff, like when I walked under one, it gave me these like tingles down my spine and just made me shudder. And then I passed one at my waist height and it like almost made me fall down. And there was one -- I was coming up to one that was on the floor -- and I just kind of totally like freaked out.  And I can't remember exactly what I did, but this assistant just kind of was walking along ahead of me and this was normal, and who was I to think it wasn't. And I think that I forgot something out of my locker, and I had to go all the way back around, but I went the long way and I wasn't going to go the short way, so I went the long way again. And then I finally got to the auditorium and the show was like starting already. And there were bleachers in there and I was walking down these big bleacher things, and actually there were like bleachers on the side and everybody in the middle had like normal seats. And I was going to sit on like one of the big bleacher platforms up real close so I could see. But I got there and I sat down, and Celine Dion was like in these long leather pants and this black top like I have, and she was singing something -- I don't remember what -- and then in the middle of a song she like takes off her clothes in front everybody and changes into this black dress that's kind of to her knees. And nobody does anything, nobody in the video audience or the real audience does anything. They're just like, ""Okay, this is normal.""  You know, that's all I can remember. And I think there was some guy, like Michael Jackson who was singing too, and that's all. Obviously this was a spin-off on the Dome offices. It's just that my imagination went absolutely crazy because the Grady House had a whole house system too, and, of course, theirs sounded nice, but now I hope I'm not going to have this dreadful memory every time I hear a whole house system like that. It's just that I had this dying curiosity of how they work and what makes them work and how they're wired and stuff. But when I don't know these things, it's kind of frightful.

We (my brother and I and the other children) were sitting outside in the dirt.  It was a tiny space for as many of us as there were.  There was a Jewish boy who actually dared to talk to the authorities.  We just paced in the dirt, tracing the cyclone fence that confined us.  This wasn't just our outside realm to spend the day- it was also our only area to sleep and eat.  There was a separate enclosure with a single football.  There was another area with cages and 2-channel, staticky TVs.  There was no shelter from rain.  We were assigned tasks, even as mundane as the pacing.  A boy who was my brother and a little girl somehow made it through a small gap in a gate at an opportune time of retrieving the football.  I faltered in fear and didn't try to escape.

They had planned an escape attempt and I was supposed to go.  So the other boy and I used another's misfortune as a distraction as our opportunity to escape.  I think it was the Jewish boy who was caught for hiding a possession in the dirt.   He ran not 3 feet from the overseer to uncover a pickaxe.  The other boy and I made our way to the caged area.  There was an ugly exchange of using the pickaxe as a weapon against the fierce lady, barely slowing her down.  The walls of the cages and the TVs toppled on her.  We were free from the detention area, but we were fugitives.  I followed the instructions given by the leader of our escape.  We descended into a gutter.

524,madeline1-hs,Madeline 1: High School,64,HS:09/07/99,"It was near Halloween.  There were drag races around the house.  Every time it was a new set of vehicles.  Motorcycles, AC Transit busses, and so on.  I sat ready to pick up the phone at the sound of a crash.  It was like several dreams were taking place at once, with scene cutaways.  There was 'old Mrs. Heniwick', an acting teacher.  We were balancing Popsicle roadblocks on a truck, as if they were Legos.  The scene reverted to the races.  I had several friends over.  The house was set for a party; the dining room table was pushed to the wall.  A friend stood there, me in front of the pantry door.  Beside my friend formed a being; Death.  He was not completely solid, but made up of a thick black mist.  I looked towards it and the form changed.  He dropped from about 6 feet tall to about 4 feet, and he grew wider.  His ruddy eyes became visible.  A deep, doubled, growling voice rumbled, ""I have come for YOU!"" and the thick black mist descended heavily upon me. I was afraid, but I didn't want the fear to overcome me and cause a panic; I figured that would only make being consumed more painful.  I didn't resist and dropped to the floor.  I was surrounded by the black mist.  The mist was heavy and as I inhaled, my throat constricted and I couldn't really breathe.  I was on my stomach, yet slowly spinning.  My last thought was of a discussion earlier in the night, and I was not above suspecting the whole thing was a trick.  I moved my left arm to cover my stomach from a potential tickle attack.  The spinning yellow linoleum of the kitchen floor dizzily faded out, and I awoke back in ""Mrs. Heniwick's"" classroom.  Some of the classmates were concerned.  Some thought I fainted, yet others applauded me for my 'performance'.  I was happy.  My last thoughts in death were ""okay, I guess I'll see what it is.""  I went to Mrs. Heniwick for a hug, but she is a little odd, and strict, and refuses me.  I looked to the rear of the room.

I was in the middle on the right side of the counter corner in line.  As they kept calling, I eventually ended up on the very end on the left side.  It was an hour and a half wait.  They kept taking people around me.  I ordered four burgers and a fish sandwich for Cat, two orders of fries, a root beer, orange soda, and they didn't have zucchini pieces like I wanted.  I got the fries, though minimal serving sizes, and the drinks, but the sandwiches never came.  I was upset.  While waiting in line before ordering, someone approached me and asked where I was working now- no longer sleeping on the steps outside the bank.  I had trouble explaining that I did that while waiting for my mother, not because I was a bum.  While waiting for the food, I talked to Dharma and Abbey (from Dharma and Greg) who were in line next to me.  Like old friends.  I felt good because I knew they'd help out if I were having problems.  Dharma sure was tall.  Finally I gave up and left without the food.  I couldn't find the car- someone had moved it.  I ran into my classmate Dawn and her mom.  Finally I found the car, but the key wouldn't open the door.  Dawn had already left.  I willed the key to fit the lock so I could at least open the door.  Things changed after that.

There was a sort of tunnel in the back (where the front is) of the library.  She had to go in to get one of them.  I had to go into one of the science rooms in C-Hall in order to do something towards testing my little fridge for college.  I guess the fridge itself was there.  I tried the ice cube tray, and put some water in a bottle with lotion in order to test the freezing capabilities.  I had to get my eyes checked for some reason.  When I was done with the fridge, I went in.  My 10th grade history teacher Mr. March was the one doing the testing.  He was with someone; I was sitting and waiting.  I thought to ask him if he'd prefer me to leave, to which he replied with a prompt and irritated affirmative.  I saw some results of what letters the man had thought were displayed, and when I left he was squinting with one eye, and looking at a blue laser picture of a man with a hat on.  I was called in.  I sat (lay) down.  There was a small metal dish mounted in the corner, with various size holes in it.  He shined the blue laser at it, moving it around, first in a circle, then back and forth...I thought my job was to guess where it was focusing; at which hole was it closest.  That was not the case.  He asked me why it looked the way it did.  I was fairly clueless, but made a couple guesses.  He impatiently and coldly told me I was wrong, and explained it, as if I should have known.  Then I was to identify the shape drawn with the blue laser; it was the man in a hat, his face showing on both sides.  I was explaining the faces I saw when he cut me off and spun the chair around.  His voice began to reveal a wicked German or Austrian sort of accent.  He asked me another question, disinterested.  He rolled up my left pant leg and told me to put my leg in the brace (looked like a used cast).  I did, but I started asking him what he was doing, I was getting very nervous.  ""What are you doing, my knees are fine! You don't need to...""  He just told me to shut up and let him work.  He was doing something with a motorized gadget; somehow I knew he was cutting the skin flap off of my kneecap, even though I didn't feel anything.  I tried to struggle a little, but not much so I wouldn't get hurt worse.  I didn't know why I didn't feel it, or why he was doing it.  The chair was rotating in circles.  Finally he stopped.

It was like a meeting of a bunch of volleyball teams.  At first there was a great rivalry.  Climbing outside railings to get to people and things.  The place was enormous.  A bit of rivalry started to settle, though each team still had their specific colored shirts and stayed in their respective groups.  I was hanging around some of them; they were talking about drugs.  One interrupted and asked me if it (using drugs) was spiritual for me.  I can't remember the slang term he used, but it was odd.  We were all waiting.  I went for a walk and lapped the building several times.  At this point, I was delivered the instructions for my 'special moves' for the operation, like the moves in a video game.  I practiced them as I went around the building.  The hallways around the large center area was like the gym of the university near my parent's house, with upper balconies like basketball nets.  I walked around the halls and practiced.  Blowing a kiss created large illuminating blue lips.  Pulling joined hands away from one another created a vertical blue line with a loop in the center.  Extending my left hand to the left and my right hand forward did something as well.  As I walked, there were holes in the inner wall.  Inside you could see destruction and flames.  The whole crowd watched as an ignorantly courageous girl approached a demon in the wall.  The five foot tall face was made up of flames and dark spots.  It wasn't long before the poor girl was incinerated.  Then, someone from my group pushed me forward, volunteering me like it was all in fun.  I tried to say no, but was not successful with the crowd.  I stood about 4 feet from the demon's face.  I did a couple of moves with no effect.  I looked around, and spoke a little to the demon.  I stopped using the futile moves; the other girl only succeeded in making the demon laugh and feel stronger.  I started to talk to it, clueless and completely winging it.  I must have gotten the idea from the power kisses, I think.  What had come to mind was that you can't fight violence with violence.  I told the demon I loved him.  I tried to reason with him, and even mentioned marriage.  Eventually he, too, became a pile of ash.  Everyone cheered.  Walking out, I believe there were four ash piles; I'm not sure where the other kids found their death.

I opened the window shade to see a dead body hanging grimly from a noose attached to the tree.  How I do not know.  Blood was dripping from the neck; I guess the rope had cut through it.  In any case, the head was missing. I don't know if it was actually missing at this point, or if I realized that later when I found the head.  I certainly didn't spend much time looking at it.  I backed away from the window in a hysterical fit.  I originally assumed it was a gang's doing.  The victim was a classmate Wally.  My mother held up much better than I.

Two guys walked in, and I asked Stuart if that was them, the guys who robbed us the day before.  He didn't think so, but I did.  Sure enough, there were a lot of people this time, trying to hijack the plane.  It was rather unorganized.  A hostage was held at threat.  She moved, and I took a shot at her captor.  One down.  My gun wasn't really a gun...looked like a spray bottle.  The lead hijacker came and sat down in front of Stuart.  I asked Stuart to hand me some more ammo; I was out.  He said he'd thrown his gun away already.  An old man tried to poke another hijacker with his cane.  I took a cane from someone and tried jamming it into the hijacker's neck.  He turned around.  I tried wrapping it tightly around his nose.  It didn't work. (Duh)  He just got annoyed and turned back around.  A woman across the aisle was panicking.  People from the other side of the plane just started to walk by and slide out of the plane.  Stuart and my mother had.  My dad had gone to the other side of the plane.  I went after him and told him to get off...I was planning on staying to help take back control on the plane.  On the other side of the plane was a doorway, like the windowed area on the cruise boat.  I followed my father that way.  It was very cloudy outside.  All grey.  It was like stepping into the past.  An old movie in black and white.  On the way back, after convincing my father to go, we passed through like a jail cell bathroom.  Bars.  The toilet was right in front of the sink, in the middle of the room.  I took one last look before passing back through the doorway into the plane.  ""So this is the past...""  Walking through the back of the plane, my father stopped and opened a door out onto the balcony.  The ledge was at first only 4 inches wide, with a railing about a foot.  He stepped out, and I followed, holding onto the door.  He showed me the moon lighting up the water and the clouds (I could have sworn it was a plane, but sure seemed like a boat...)  It was very intriguing and pretty.  Finally (I kind of woke up) I got him off the plane.  I went across the aisle to the panicked lady.

Last time we were here, we didn't have the time.  We made our way out of the very crowded place and watched the house rise again to make a lap.  It had long pillars which bended, and in the rear had a strong cable pulley system; the back end lagged, like limping.  Dragged by the front.  I wondered how, then, the ride was so smooth on the inside.  It was very crowded, and my father got left behind in a wave of people.  Somehow he and my mother found one another, but I, being a child, was supposed to go elsewhere.  I saw my one of brother Stuart's high school math teachers Mr. Pelt in the top of a roundabout type of thing, like at Great America.  My parents were supposed to go up there.  What I was doing there I do not know.  I went to where the kids were meant to be.  So many little ones.  We were packed in and cushions were laid on top of us.  I recall some sort of white powder, and upon leaving (escaping?) and rejoining my parents, other younger children were leaving with adults.  I overheard one man saying he came out ahead.  More children than he went in with.  It was some sort of experiment.  I wondered what they had done to us in there.  Some gap in time later, I was in a small green house, almost like a trailer.

He smiled.  I sat up.  He vanished for a moment, but re-formed.  Even though he was blue and in the sky, I reached out my arms as if to hug him.  The sky and clouds surrounding him stretched on infinitely and he could not be seen.  Yet I didn't feel like I wasn't allowed to hug him; that was just the way of it.

I soon realized, however, that I had put no eye makeup on, so I scrambled through my bag looking for mascara and eyeliner. I ran to the bathroom. In my dream, I thought I looked great in my shiny silver dress and strappy high heels, even though I would probably wear neither of those items in real life. So I finished applying eye makeup and tried to find Aaron. I had been looking forward to gala for a while because I wanted to be with him. On the bleachers of the rink was every guy from my high school. But I was frustrated because I only wanted to see Aaron, but instead I could only see every guy from high school. I kept hoping he would just find me and pull me away. And even as I started waking up, I tried to stay asleep to see if I would ever find Aaron, but I never did.

And again, I just felt so helpless, like I couldn't do anything to make myself feel better or change the situation, because I wanted to be with Aaron, but I also wanted to stay friends with him, so I had to be friends with Britta. The dream was odd though because Britta wasn't a pretty blonde girl, but rather a tiny Vietnamese girl. And I liked her. And even though she was the Britta, Aaron's Britta, there was some part of her that secretly wasn't. It was weird, but I knew this to be true.

So then I walked home (my job was near my house I guess), and on the way I heard someone putting down women. I ran over and started shouting at them before I realized it was Jackson. I later learned that he was speaking at his mother's funeral, and that I had misunderstood what he had said. I found him later that night to apologize, and he took me in his arms and kissed me. And I kissed him back and we were hugging and grabbing at each other. I was trying to remember if we had been doing this same thing years ago and just continuing it now, or if this is the first time it had happened. I must have thought it was the first time, but in any event, things began to heat up really fast and I remembered we were supposed to be at a funeral, so we broke apart. And then we were sitting in a golf cart, and I felt so...in love. No one around me mattered. I kept fixing his tie or holding his hand. Gabby (random) saw us and either was jealous of me, or wanted to protect Aaron from getting hurt, because she really disapproved of Jackson and me.

620,bea2,Bea 2: a college student,33,12/31/2009,"I had a dream that I was engaged or betrothed to marry Wyatt, without really knowing it. I think I woke up on my wedding day and had all these things to do. I think I had some recollection in my dream of having been proposed to. And at the time I was thinking, Well, I could do a lot worse. But I'm only 21. Do I really want to get married this early? Does he even love me? And we haven't even had sex yet. What if it's not good? Anyway, I said yes anyway. So that day I had to buy presents for My mother and my father, because that was some sort of new tradition. Wyatt and I were riding in a limousine to go to the store, and I just kept thinking, This is so unfair. He still gets another year of college, and I will have graduated and will have to pay his tuition. I can't do that! And what if he hooks up with other girls while he is at school and I am working? We got to the store and I bought finger puppets for my mother and father. When I got home, all my underwear was strung up on a line hanging outside the door. I wasn't embarrassed, since Wyatt was going to be my husband, but I also didn't understand why it was strung up there. My mother had told me she had made all the arrangements for the wedding, which I suppose made my decision easier, since I didn't have to think about anything. All I know is that my father spent $160,000.00 on the wedding, which I felt bad about, since I don't even really remember having ever gotten engaged or telling them about it. I kept thinking that I was only 21 and had so much more to do in life. At the same time, Wyatt was a good guy and I could certainly learn to love him. On the way to the beach where we were supposed to get married, it started snowing. So that upset me, since the wedding was supposed to be outside. All the flowers were dead when we got there. And I didn't have a wedding dress. I guess that was my only responsibility, but since I had no idea about this wedding, I didn't realize I had to get a dress.

623,bea2,Bea 2: a college student,36,01/04/2010,"Last night I had a dream that I had to go to Japan with my mother for some reason. We drove to the airport, which was at my high school, and I was able to pack everything into this small DVD case. I asked if we were going to drive to California and fly from there, or if we were just going to drive to JFK and fly from there. My mother said it would be better to just drive to JFK. We got onto the plane, and even though the flight was supposed to be 12 hours, we were only going for 1 day. When we got to Japan, I remember that instead of all the skyscrapers, there were these incredible trees from Avatar. They had these phosphorescent leaves that lit up depending on the season. I guess all the seasons went by in the 1 day we were in Tokyo, because the leaves changed from pink, to orange, to green, to blue, which was supposed to indicate a whole year going by. They were beautiful against the night sky. On the way home, my brother and my father joined us, and we all went to a dentist's office together. I don't know why, but apparently the dentists were better in Japan. The dentist spoke English, but all the magazines in the waiting room were in Japanese. The ""dentist"" was eating yogurt and a Snickers bar, which I remember thinking was weird, since he was a dentist and shouldn't eat candy. This ""dentist"" turned out to be an old friend of my mother and father's, and we stayed at his house for another night for a party. The dentist was an older man, and I found him very attractive, even though I don't find older men attractive in real life. He was putting all this food on the tables to occupy everyone, and then he cornered me and started flirting with me. I think I had been drinking wine, because I felt a little giddy and flirtatious too. He was wearing a gray suit and looked very sharp.

624,bea2,Bea 2: a college student,37,01/06/2010,"My first dream was that I was on a show like America's Next Top Model with all my girlfriends. We had to do different tasks or photo shoots before one of us was eliminated. I remember being worried because everyone else had really elaborate outfits, and I was only wearing a black t-shirt. One of the judges in the audience came up to me and asked if I was in another ethnic group. I told her I was in my ethnic group, but she still wrote down another ethnic group on my info sheet. Then Abigail and I were taking a break from the photo shoots and we went to the library, where we ate dried mangoes and peanut M&Ms.; The next morning we all had to take showers, and I had 3 sponges, but no soap, so I wasn't able to. In my next dream I was skiing with my family somewhere, but I still needed a new winter coat. My mother and I were going to go shopping. I think it was Christmas or Thanksgiving or something, because this old woman was there and she was supposed to be my grandmother, but she wasn't. My father was making apple pie shaped into funny faces. My brother was making chocolate butter cream frosting. I had two pieces of this incredible cake (it tasted so good in my dream) before I felt like a pig and was so glad I had only eaten that in my dream and not in real life. My mother and I left for the mall. The car was parked in the backyard instead of in our driveway, but anyway. I tried on lots of different coats, but they only had sizes 29 and 32, which I don't even think are real sizes in women's coats. I ended up not finding anything and left. When I got home I had to baby sit some random family I've never met before. I brought 101 Dalmatians coloring books and two boxes of crayons, because I guess I knew there was a little girl who would want to color.

625,bea2,Bea 2: a college student,38,01/07/2010,"Last night I had a series of weird dreams. First, Sydney and I were in our room and we were part of some game show with some of our friends and other random people I don't remember. Every time we got a question right, we took shots of vodka together. Mario was there too and kept warning us to be careful. Later, I was in Adam's with Sydney, Jillian, and Reese. We were trying to decide when we should go get sushi for dinner. I think it was after final exams, because I was running on a treadmill in Adam's, and didn't have a care in the world. Next, there was some sort of funeral or memorial. All the boys on the hockey team were wearing the same team tie, and had to recite a piece of a eulogy for this person who had died. I remember seeing Trevor and saying something about him to my father. He told me that Trevor wasn't his real last name; rather it was ""Sierra"" and he just went by Trevor because it sounded manlier. Although I was shocked, I think I knew this. I felt out of place that I did not have this blue silk team tie, or the equivalent, and I also wondered why I was at this memorial, since I didn't seem to know who had died. Next I was in a building in Manhattan somewhere. I had ordered pizza and the delivery guy was doing a dance outside my window. A-Wall was there too. We were hunting around in our garden (inside the apartment) looking for a plant that would in ten years grow to be my husband.

My mother said she had been driving each car in shifts, because they were both some kind of new stick shift I didn't know how to drive yet. I was also dreaming about floating down some river with other RAs, and that was our mid-year training.

627,bea2,Bea 2: a college student,40,01/09/2010,"I had a really elaborate dream last night that took place sometime in late May/early June, right between final exams and senior week before graduation. I think I was commuting between my home state and my college state for that last week because I was both at home and at my college . I think first, we had some big party to kick off senior week, but we also had something early the next morning, so people were trying to get to sleep. I was in a huge bedroom with Lyla, some other girls I can't remember, Miley, and Adam. I think Susanna was there too (in the abstract, not physically there), but she and Adam had broken up, or something. In any event, Adam was sleeping next to me in this bed, and he was tickling me and flirting with me, and I was trying to be quiet since everyone else wanted to go to sleep. Javier was there too, and some boy who introduced himself to me as ""Lacrosse."" Next, I was at home, and maybe my brother was graduating from high school again or something, because I was baking him a cake. It was a long, rectangular sheet cake with blue icing. I ran out of icing, so I had to make more, but no matter how much butter, cream cheese, or powdered sugar I put in, it tasted disgusting and came out this terrible shade of maroon. Finally I gave up, and just colored (with a blue marker) the parts that didn't have icing. Also, I remember it being extremely dark outside, even though it was early in the day. Maybe there was some kind of solar eclipse? So then I had to get back to my college , and my father told me I could bike there; it would take 2 hours to get to one town, and then I would have to walk 30 miles to the college town. This was crazy to me, and I couldn't understand how I was supposed to do that. I guess I got up there though, because there I was again in a Lily Pulitzer dress, flouncing around. There was a beautiful abstract expressionist painting on the wall, with the initials W.K. I knew it was Kandinsky, even though it didn't really look like his work. I think maybe it was some new, undiscovered painting, but it was beautiful --I wish it existed in real life! All of a sudden I was back at home again, asleep in my bed. I was dreaming (in my dream) that the reason Adam had picked Susanna over me was because she had sex with him, and I wouldn't. I guess in my dream this had happened to me a different time with a different guy, so it was a huge revelation. I woke up (in my dream) and got out of bed. I started applying black eyeliner to my eyes (I wanted to make Adam realize he should have chosen me) before realizing I hadn't washed my face or anything. Then there was a knock on my door, and I said, ""Hold on!"" while I grabbed a light blue robe (which I do not own) out of my closet. I opened my door and my father was there saying that my brother really needed us (I can't remember why), so I should probably not go back to my college today. Although Adam and my college and graduation had been on my mind only 20 seconds ago, I nodded fervently and said that yes of course I would stay at home if my brother needed me. My father said it was 10:30, so we should get going (to where, I don't know). Then I woke up in real life, and it was only 9:30, and my father had already left for work.",really elaborate dream last night take place sometime late may early june right final exam senior week graduation think commute home state college state last week home college think first big party kick senior week also something early next morning people try get sleep huge bedroom lyla girl remember miley adam think susanna abstract physically adam broken something event adam sleep next bed tickle flirt try quiet since everyone else want go sleep javier boy introduce lacrosse next home maybe brother graduate high school something bake cake long rectangular sheet cake blue ice run ice make matter much butter cream cheese powder sugar put taste disgust come terrible shade maroon finally give color blue marker part ice also remember extremely dark outside even though early day maybe kind solar eclipse get back college father tell could bike would take hour get one town would walk mile college town crazy understand suppose guess get though lily pulitzer dress flounce around beautiful abstract expressionist paint wall initial know kandinsky even though really look like work think maybe new undiscovered painting beautiful wish exist real life sudden back home asleep bed dream dream reason adam pick susanna sex guess dream happen different time different guy huge revelation wake dream get bed start apply black eyeliner eye want make adam realize chosen realize wash face anything knock door say hold grab light blue robe closet open door father say brother really need u remember probably go back college today although adam college graduation mind second ago nod fervently say yes course would stay home brother need father say get go know woke real life father already leave work,7.8968263,11.208419,650,5,6,4,5,6,8,6,8,9,12,1
628,bea2,Bea 2: a college student,41,01/12/2010,"I had the worst dream last night. It started out that I was at a party somewhere in some basement, at my college, but at a place that definitely doesn't actually exist. It was a huge labyrinth and very dingy and dimly lit. At the beginning, the party was fun. People were playing Beirut and there was music. I think it might have been a costume party because I think I was wearing a bumblebee or some other bug costume. Erick was there looking for me. I couldn't find him, but everyone else I saw told me he was looking for me. I saw notes written by him looking for me, notes like, ""Bea, meet me upstairs."" Anyway, the dream turned into a nightmare very quickly. All of a sudden we were running away from the building. It was daylight outside. People were screaming and running in every direction to avoid these gigantic machine monsters that were shooting people down like in District 9. Nora and I were trying to hide underneath a white plastic tarp. I was breathing so quickly and was so scared. I heard the machine's voice saying, ""I can see your blue shoe underneath that white tarp. Come out now."" I wondered if just maybe Nora was wearing blue shoes too, but she wasn't, and I knew the monster was calling for me. I waited until I thought maybe he had gone and then ran out to find my next hiding spot. I hid behind a wooden shed, but the second I peered around to see where the monster was, it shot me in the arm. It was really painful! I thought for sure I was going to die. All of a sudden I was lying on a gurney and being rushed back into the basement, which was no longer the site of a party, but a makeshift hospital. I couldn't move or speak, but I could hear the ""doctors"" around me saying I had almost no time to live, and discussing how they should take my organs now while they were still fresh. I was horrified and tried to speak to tell them that I was going to be fine, but they started draining blood and taking my organs. I don't remember the gory details, but I woke up in the same position (in my dream) after they had supposedly taken all my body parts. When I came to, however, I felt fine, as if nothing had happened. Even my costume was still intact. I was so happy I leapt off the gurney and raced around following the notes Erick had left me until I ran straight into him. I was so happy, but he looked terrified. He said we had to get out of here immediately. He brought me to some beautiful library with dark paneled walls, gorgeous built in shelves, and thousands and thousands of books. There were beautiful leather chairs, brass desk lamps, and huge skylights for the roof. It was dark and snowy outside, but cozy and warm inside. My whole family was there watching some National Geographic program about Siberian tigers. I started chatting online with Erick and some other friends. What was weird was that Erick was able to talk to me, but it was as if my other friends were ignoring me. I told Erick this and he said, ""It's because you're dead."" I distinctly remember my heart dropping as I realized this. He said that the only reason I could see him too was because the same thing had happened to him after he had been shot, and since we were both dead, we were on ""the other side"" and could talk to each other, but people who were still alive couldn't hear us. I guess I thought my family had been too absorbed in the TV to say anything to me when I got home, so I tried to see if they would acknowledge me now. I tried talking to my mother and brother separately, and then yelling at the top of my lungs ""I AM GOING TO KILL MYSELF"" to see if that would get their attention. But Erick seemed to be right; they just couldn't hear me. I started crying and ran upstairs, which was my room, even though we don't have a library like that in our house. I found my hairbrush, which I also knew to be some kind of sniper rifle, and ran into my room to shoot myself. If I died again, it means I was actually alive, but if nothing happened, then I must be dead. It was the most horrifying feeling and I kept trying to wake myself up. I literally said to myself ""Bea, wake up! Wake up! This can't be real!"" I looked into my full-length mirror and shot myself in the temple twice. I heard the gunshot and felt the excruciating pain, but got up right after I had shot myself. I started sobbing, since I was really dead. I ran back to the basement where all that stuff had happened, hoping to find someone who could bring me back to life. I was crying and screaming and trying to find anyone who would listen to me for just a minute. I hadn't said goodbye to anyone, and all I needed was a few days on ""the other side"" so I could talk to the living. It was so horrible, and every time I tried to wake myself up, I couldn't, so I just decided that I must have not been dreaming. And then I woke up, thank GOD!",worst dream last night start party somewhere basement college place definitely actually exist huge labyrinth dingy dimly light begin party fun people play beirut music think might costume party think wear bumblebee bug costume erick look find everyone else saw tell look saw note write look note like bea meet upstairs anyway dream turn nightmare quickly sudden run away build daylight outside people scream run every direction avoid gigantic machine monster shoot people like district nora try hide underneath white plastic tarp breathe quickly scar heard machine voice say see blue shoe underneath white tarp come wonder maybe nora wear blue shoe know monster call wait think maybe go ran find next hiding spot hid behind wooden shed second peer around see monster shot arm really painful thought sure go die sudden lie gurney rush back basement longer site party makeshift hospital move speak could hear doctor around say almost time live discus take organ still fresh horrify try speak tell go fine start drain blood take organ remember gory detail wake position dream supposedly take body part come however felt fine nothing happen even costume still intact happy leapt gurney race around follow note erick leave ran straight happy look terrify say get immediately bring beautiful library dark panel wall gorgeous build shelf thousand thousand book beautiful leather chair brass desk lamps huge skylight roof dark snowy outside cozy warm inside whole family watch national geographic program siberian tiger start chat online erick friend weird erick able talk friends ignore tell erick say dead distinctly remember heart drop realize say reason could see thing happen shot since dead side could talk people still alive hear u guess think family absorb tv say anything get home try see would acknowledge tried talk mother brother separately yell top lung go kill see would get attention erick seem right hear start cry run upstairs room even though library like house find hairbrush also know kind sniper rifle run room shoot die mean actually alive nothing happen must dead horrify feel keep try wake literally say bea wake wake real look full length mirror shot temple twice hear gunshot felt excruciate pain get right shot start sob since really dead run back basement stuff happen hop find someone could bring back life cry scream try find anyone would listen minute say goodbye anyone need day side could talk live horrible every time try wake decide must dream wake thank god,11.323082,8.826798,949,10,12,9,23,12,14,4,14,27,25,1
629,bea2,Bea 2: a college student,42,01/14/2010,"Last night my dreams were not my own. I was confused and utterly clueless throughout the whole series. First I was in Mexico at the beach and stuck on some sort of movie set. Some blond girl was running around for a scene, so all the exits were closed off so people wouldn't come in. For some reason, I was trapped on the wrong side of this barrier, and all I wanted to do was go back to the beach. It was so warm and sunny that I was almost shocked when I woke up that I wasn't in Mexico. All of a sudden I was transported to some humungous house in the south of France with Abigail. There was a family there, but it wasn't my family and it wasn't Abigail's. Someone had some kind of disorder, and the family was making a video to send to a committee to get better hospital care for their kid. I was thrown into the middle of it, wearing some sort of costume, and having utterly no idea why I was there. Then Abigail and I were made to go shopping. We found a Wal-Mart (in the south of France). While we were shopping, Abigail started stealing other people's groceries that they had already paid for. The manager of the store caught us, but Abigail managed to get away. She caught me and started interrogating me. I began to cry until she said, ""I know it was your friend, not you, so I'll let you go if you find her and turn her in."" I didn't know what to do and only prayed that Abigail had run far enough away that I wouldn't find her and have to turn her in. Then I was in a classroom somewhere with Edwin and we were laughing and joking about something. Then I was at a ball somewhere wearing a long silver dress and Philip was trying to call me. I didn't want to talk to him so I snapped my phone in two. Then I realized I wasn't wearing a bra and became really self-conscious. Finally, there was some dog who was trying to follow me around, and I realized it was someone named Doug, a person I have never actually met in real life, but whom I knew in my dream to be my soul mate, who had the ability to transform into a dog.

When I got there, my father and I had to buy down vests, and all I wanted was for it to be warm. We were on a train to go shopping, but then I was on some pier in Brooklyn. Roberto was there and we were holding hands and walking down the pier. I jumped into the water, but it turns out it was actually this motor oil that could kill me. I was spluttering and swallowing the oil and trying to swim to the dock. I ended up spitting in real life, trying to get the oil out of my mouth in my dream. Then I was running on a staircase that was like the Guggenheim, except it was 14 stories. I tried to climb up the stairs, but the building was jello-like and really difficult to stand up.

632,bea2,Bea 2: a college student,45,01/20/2010,"I can't remember the exact order of my dreams. I think first I was going back to the city in Spain, where I studied abroad. We landed and immediately went to the Reina Sofia. There was a Willem de Kooning and Goncharova exhibit, except instead of their paintings, they were frescoes that were attached to the wall. And despite this, the paint still stuck out in thick brushstrokes. It was beautiful. The frescoes were oddly shaped, sort of like Frank Stella pieces, and they were all over the walls and ceiling. There were Picasso sketches that I am making up in my head right now, sort of curved cubism in reds and pinks, drawings I'll only ever see in my head. Anyway, I am walking around the Reina Sofia and I bump into Kit, Philip, Miley, and some other guys. I think Abigail was with me originally, but I was surprised to see these guys in Madrid. All of a sudden the Reina Sofia turned into this terrible maze, and there was this psychotic 12-year-old boy with a gun who was chasing us all around. I was now with a group of girls (none of whom were identifiable), and we were all tearing through this maze, which was perched on a mountaintop, so it was very precarious. A lot of the girls were shot. I dove under a table and went limp and tried to pretend I was already dead. Similar to the other dream I had, someone called me out on faking death. I was terrified and sweating, and sand was sticking to my face. I was trying so hard to cry silently and wake myself up at the same time. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't wake myself up. It was like I was literally stuck in this dream. Anyway, the kid who was killing everyone came up behind me and I cringed, waiting for him to shoot me, but then I leapt up and faced him. He looked scared, and I tried to calm him down and talk him out of killing everyone. He said he felt like a monster, and I tried to reassure him that he wasn't and that he was still young and just coming into himself. I somehow got out of that nightmare and found myself in the dining hall at my college waiting in the salad bar line. There was some guy behind me who graduated a few years ago, who I can't name, but I think I remember thinking he was cute. He was standing behind me and flirting with me as I made my salad, which was spinach, tomatoes, pesto, hard-boiled eggs, and chickpeas. When I walked to my table to sit down with my friends, I realized that it was graduation dinner, and I was horrified that I had somehow missed my last semester at my college.

I could see a tiny scorpion walking around on the coffee table adjacent to me and became worried that it would walk up towards me! I was then somewhere with Alondra and was getting married to Channing Tatum. I was confused as to why we were getting married, when Alondra and Andre had been dating for 9 months and weren't even engaged yet. Alondra assured me that this was a good decision. I was wearing a veil and up at the altar. Alondra was behind me, pushing me along. Channing Tatum kissed me, which was fine, but I just didn't understand why I was getting married. Next, he and I were in some really nice boutique. I was picking out different lingerie slips and dresses. I didn't realize they were lingerie until I tried them on and they were completely transparent. I was horrified and ran home, where my dad was purchasing the portrait of me.

I left to go do something but when I returned to their apartment, the five men were there too. I was really scared and found Andy, who drove me away.

In my nightmare, I was a mule for carrying drugs across the border to Turkey, Iraq, Kazakhstan, and Israel. There was this horrible, creepy, oily, and disgusting man in his 40s, who was my boss/drug lord/drug dealer. The drugs were some weird form of cocaine and ecstasy in this red and black pill that I hid under my breasts. In order to get across the border, my boss would pretend to be fondling me while he took the drugs out. I was crying the entire time, weeping, sobbing, and doing anything to get out of it. I ran into Kingston once when I was about to leave Kazakhstan to get more drugs. I made the most helpless, pleading face, and he got the point and saved me. He grabbed me and sprinted me across the border, where the guy couldn't bother me anymore. I was so relieved that I started crying and shaking and sweating, and I'm pretty sure that was happening in real life as I woke up from my nightmare into my dream. Next, I had a dream that I was studying Michelangelo's sketches for the Sistine Chapel ceiling. The original for The Creation of Adam was not the iconic image of Adam reaching out to God, but rather a sketchy cartoon of God holding Adam as if he were giving him the Heimlich maneuver. I was confused because I know the real version so well, but apparently this was a sketch that no one had ever seen before and was the real creation scene.",dream last night start absolute bad nightmare ever nightmare within dream woke nightmare still dream nightmare mule carry drug across border turkey iraq kazakhstan israel horrible creepy oily disgust man bos drug lord drug dealer drug weird form cocaine ecstasy red black pill hide breast order get across border bos would pretend fondle take drug cry entire time weep sob anything get ran kingston leave kazakhstan get drug make helpless plead face get point save grab sprint across border guy bother anymore relieve start cry shake sweat pretty sure happen real life wake nightmare dream next dream study michelangelo sketch sistine chapel ceiling original creation adam iconic image adam reach god rather sketchy cartoon god hold adam give heimlich maneuver confuse know real version well apparently sketch one ever see real creation scene,10.884385,11.353766,303,3,4,4,6,3,6,1,6,15,8,1

I saw him in the mirror and my heart fluttered. I kept doing sit-ups and all of a sudden I was at the off-campus boys lacrosse team's house with Kit. We were dancing and kissing and it was fun. Then it was senior week (the week of festivities leading up to graduation) and I was running to the library in a blue dress. I think all the seniors had to gather there. I burst through the doors in the library and realized I was drunk. It was a strange feeling, because I think what I had been nervous about before was being late, not drunk. Kit was there wearing a pink and white striped haberdashery shirt and he hugged me and bemoaned the fact that we had never dated at college. He said he wanted to see me next week after we graduated, but I didn't want to for some reason. The inside of the library was constructed in a sort of Frank Lloyd Wright-esque way, in that there were all these steel rafters and open staircase shafts. The building was minimalist and modern and blended in with the environment so perfectly that the ocean waves were swelling up and crashing into the library walls. All of a sudden, I guess the entire setting changed and we were on Pandora, the planet in Avatar. There was a huge wave swelling up about to crash over, and I had to run all the way up to the top of the wave before it crested. I think I did, but then all of a sudden I'm right back in the middle of senior week. Alondra is doing stand-up comedy, but no one is laughing.

Then he said he wanted to introduce me to his mother, but since we had only met this semester, I figured he was just being friendly. Still, I was flattered and excited. But then I think we had to drive to the field house because his practice was starting soon. We drove over there and then that was the end of that. Then I was in my high school dining hall with Alondra and some random freshmen from college. I was trying to explain why this new painting called ""Emily Combusted"" was so important and innovative. It was on the front page of the New York Time Arts section. I was talking about how it was part of this new movement called ""ir-realism,"" which is a post-modern sort of surrealism, a style of painting that encompassed the subconscious and wanted to investigate its inner workings, but did so in a more politically self-conscious way. The exhibition that was being reviewed in the Times comprised some hundred paintings that were like Dali paintings looked at through a microscope far away.

First of all, I was going down to a store to interview again. My father was writing out this list of things I should wear and say in my interview, and it was really stressing me out. He told me to bring this special coat from Vienna, and I couldn't see how that would make a difference, but oh well. Then Tony and I were skating and playing hockey in the arena. We were sort of scrimmaging one on one, but we were also hooking up on the ice. It was a sort of violent passionate event. I would try to get the puck away from him in the corner, wedging his body up against the boards as much as I could, and then we would be on the ice, helmets off, going at it (not sex). Later, when I was changing in the locker room, I discovered that my entire right thigh was covered in hair. I was horrified, not understanding how that had happened. It wasn't even just regular leg hair that I could shave off; it was like fur. But it was only on my right thigh. Anyway, next I think I was down in New York for this interview at a store. Eleanor was there teaching a class that I may have had to go audit before my interview. There were 2 other girls who were identical to me who were also interviewing at the store, and I became very discouraged. I didn't know how I was going to make myself stand out. I had my alarm clock with me for some reason instead of my phone. Bryson and Tony started chatting with me through G-chat, but I got nervous I would confuse the two of them in my chats. Then I was in a Hallmark store trying to find an appropriate thank you card for the woman who interviewed me. This part was very vivid twenty minutes ago, but I can't remember much now.

There was some sort of party or gathering. But anyway, Calvin was there and I was supposed to hook up with him. I wanted to too, but there was some sort of understanding between the two of us that we were going to hook up, even though we've never talked before. It was as if we were just going to act on the sexual tension and there didn't have to be any sort of explanation. He was shirtless, but had on his white baseball cap.

I had to present on Lolita and then relate how that had to do with sexual abuse and rape. I had written some sort of song and had condoms with me to give out to the rest of my class. When my professor called on me, I panicked, but ended up having to present anyway. I think the presentation ended up going pretty well. Tony, as he was leaving, asked me out on a date and suggested taking me out to dinner. Of course I accepted, but then remembered that I was dating Philip. The next day, leading up to the date with Tony, I asked my friends if I should just break up with Philip, rather than cheat on him. I wondered why I was with Philip again since it hadn't worked out the first time. Then I was on a golf course wearing pink shorts and pink ankle socks and little golf shoes. I had on a white tank top and a pink ribbon in my hair, and I was skipping near where Tony was playing golf, flouncing and flirting and showing off. Then I had to drive a golf cart with Martin and one of his friends home. I was baking almond cookies that were not yet done, but I had already taken out of the oven.

646,bea2,Bea 2: a college student,59,03/18/2010,"The first part of my dream that I remember took place in an old classroom where I might have had 3rd or 4th grade. Sue and I were there with my college baseball team. The coaches and athletic directors had chosen us as managers of the team, so we were there at their first meeting. The meeting started ordinarily enough; the coach gave some inspirational speech, but then the talk devolved to girls. I distinctly remember Keegan being there and looking absolutely perfect. I whispered something to Sue about him being the captain. Martin and Trenton were there too. All of a sudden, the power went out. Sue and I scrambled out of the room to the parking lot. First we stopped at a cafe outside the classroom and we ordered caramel macchiato. When I turned around, Keegan was there. I lamented that I couldn't remember where I had parked my car and asked him if he would please help me find it. He agreed; I purposely led him in the opposite direction of where I knew my car to be so that we could spend more time together. I must have looked cold because he took off his sport coat and draped it over my shoulders. We went on walking through this rainy forest until we found my car. We had been joking about cars and baseball and clothes, and the conversation seemed so real, the banter, the flirting...I'm amazed it was only a dream. Keegan opened my car door and threw some of his stuff in. I was sad when he started walking away, but then he looked back at me and said, ""You're not driving off yet, are you? Come walk with me some more!"" Delighted, I followed him down some ravine covered in ferns and we went on chatting and laughing. Next, I was part of some secret organization on campus that was trying to change the housing lottery system. We met in this secret cave off campus that no one could find unless he or she knew about it beforehand. There were about 30 of us and we had these secret files on CDs that we were trying to erase. Drake burst in the door and demanded that we hand over the CDs. I had them in my hand. Everyone yelled at me not to give them to him, but to just throw them in the fire. I looked hesitant, so someone grabbed them from me and threw them in the fire to destroy them. I immediately ran over and yanked them from the flames and gave them to Drake. He looked at me as if he were going to hit me and ran out. Everyone started yelling at me for giving them over. ""You don't understand!"" I yelled. ""You will forgive me, but Drake may not."" A few days must have gone by, and I was manicuring the lawn outside my house --literally manicuring it with a nail file. I was upset because Drake hadn't yet called me. I thought I should just give in and call him, but I didn't want to. Just then Mommy was mad at me, but I think Martin didn't know I had given away any secret information. He offered me some of his pasta and I took a bite. Later in my dream I was eating breakfast with Trenton at Pickering.

It was only supposed to take me 4 hours to get home, and I had to get home that night since my interview in New York was the next day. I landed in Tennessee by accident and was trying to figure out how to get back in the air when I started a new dream. I was walking to Pickering from spinning class with Abigail. I saw Keegan on the way but I don't think he saw me. Then Abigail and I were standing outside Pickering talking to someone and Keegan turned back and we definitely made eye contact. He spread his arms as if he wanted me to hug him, but I was too far away. Then I went inside Pickering: Andy, Alvie, and Professor Simms were all there too.

649,bea2,Bea 2: a college student,62,03/29/2010,"I guess my first dream was that my family and I were back in Mexico. Keegan was there and I was subtly trying to get his attention. There was some sort of art auction happening, so I had my father sell this Dali painting that we had. I knew that Keegan lived on 43rd street in New York, so I tried to get my father to sell the painting to a gallery in midtown so that I would have an excuse to be around there. I think he did, but I can't remember. Then I was tanning on the edge a black infinity pool and Keegan was across the pool. I was trying to pretend I didn't know he was there, but it was pretty obvious that I did. I think I was then sitting next to him and I all of a sudden felt very chagrined, so I must have done something to embarrass myself. All of a sudden, there was some announcement throughout all Puerto Vallarta telling everyone to pack up his or her most prized possessions in a bag because a dangerous con man was coming through all the resorts and taking everyone's stuff. Only now all of a sudden, I didn't have to just zip up my suitcase, but rather we were at home and I had to pick only a few things that were that important to me. I think I threw in my iPhone and laptop, figuring that any burglar would only want those items rather than the more sentimental things. I think my father threw nothing in. When the burglar arrived, we all sat downstairs in the family room while he ransacked our house, picking out things he wanted to take. He took some of my mother's jewelry, my father's laptop, iPod, and wallet. I think at one point my father tried to say no and the burglar pulled out a gun and loaded it. He aimed it at my father and Martin and I both burst into tears, sobbing and screaming. I distinctly remember thinking ""I won't have a father in a few minutes."" I was crying so hard, but I never heard the gun shot. I realized that the burglar was just using it to instill fear in all of us. I offered to take him up to my room and let him go through all my CDs in order to distract him from my father. We went upstairs and the burglar demanded an Akon CD. I frantically rummaged through everything and never found the Akon CD. The burglar ran back downstairs and started lighting all our photo albums on fire. It was then that I realized that my laptop and iPhone were completely replaceable, but those photos were not. Then I was back in Art History 101 and hadn't studied for my final exam. I think I thought I had, but in reality I had never made flashcards or reviewed for the essays. I went into the exam and opened my blue book. The slides flashed on the screen, and I was only able to identify 4 of the 10. I reassured myself that I could make the points up on the essays, but then I realized I didn't know anything about the objects. To make matters worse, I was writing with a gigantic indelible marker, which was clumsy and awkward to hold. I could only fit a few letters in per page of my blue book. Finally, Professor Durkin came over and asked how I was doing. I told him truthfully that I was doing horrible and had not prepared for some reason and also that I had this horrible marker to write with. He helped me talk out some of the themes in ""Hanging Lantern,"" a performance piece that I completely made up in my head. I wrote out ""seeking to but failing to find one's own voice"" on my leg in pencil. I guess he had given me a pencil to replace the gigantic marker and rather than ruin another blue book, I decided to write my answers all over my skin.

650,bea2,Bea 2: a college student,63,04/02/2010,"I had the worst dream last night! So I think I was in some very random location but there was a bookstore on the hillside. Some anonymous friend and I decided to spend the night in the bookstore and read all night and just browse. So when the owner left and locked up, my friend and I just stayed. The bookstore must have been haunted or somehow possessed because that evening was really weird. First we were running through a labyrinth of human body parts. The walls were made of feet and toenails and animal claws, and everything was red and raw and smelly. There were plants made of human skin and body parts, but for some reason I just told my friend to ignore it and that it wasn't a big deal. It started raining at some point, and we took refuge at Bugler House. Some of the guys were there and wanted to party, but we didn't want to, so we went back out into the human body part maze. Then, and I don't know how this happened, but I was being raped somewhere. I think within the bookstore there was a mall or store of sorts and I was trying on clothes and some random man came in and forced me to give him head. I was crying and trying to fight him off, but he was a lot bigger than I was and was forcing himself into my mouth. I was sputtering and choking and trying to scream and it was horrible. As soon as I ran out of the dressing room after being raped in multiple ways, I ran into a street and a bus ran over me. Seriously. I felt the bus try to stop and I crumpled down as the wheels passed over me and the bumper scraped into my chest. I must have been lying on my stomach in real life because I definitely felt a physical pressure on my body and was finding it hard to breathe. I think everyone around me thought I was dead and was trying to figure out how to get rid of my body, but I knew I was still alive and was trying to yell out that I just needed to go to the hospital, but no one could hear me since I was completely winded. My friend and I found ourselves back in the bookstore and realized it was morning. We tried to leave before the owner found us, but as we were leaving, we saw police cars parked outside and knew we had been caught. The owner was striding slowly toward us carrying this long rifle. My friend and I were racing to get out and around the building and hide, but we were moving so slowly for some reason. Neither of us could just get going and it was painful to watch him approaching ever closer. He caught up with us and made us get on our knees as he held the rifle to the backs of our heads. We were crying and pleading with him not to shoot us. I had a distinct thought of ""I can't believe I have been raped, hit by a bus, and am going to be killed all in one day."" I was sobbing and thinking of my family. Then out of the middle of nowhere, this man and wife saved us. They knew the owner and told him they would take us into custody at their house. I was so relieved and grateful that I said I would do anything to earn my stay at their house and that I was just so elated to have been rescued. Well their house turned out to be a terrible orphanage. They told me my parents had died and wanted me taken care of, so I had to stay with them. They only ate steamed cabbage and pasta with no sauce and lived in the smallest, dirtiest apartment. They had some other orphans with them, plus my friend and me. Part of my keep was to clean the apartment, which was impossible because it was perpetually dirty, and I had to be the sex slave of the man. It could have been a few days later, or a month later, but I heard a knock at the door one morning. The ""father/master"" opened the door and it was my father! I was so happy I tried to yell out to him, but my owner said I had passed away. I was shouting and trying to draw attention to myself, and my father was so upset. I became so upset and started crying. I couldn't believe that my owner had lied to me about my parents dying, and that I could leave now forever and for some reason I was just physically stuck and couldn't make any noise. It was so horrible and I honestly thought it was the worst combination of things that could ever happen to me. I was so happy to wake up.",worst dream last night think random location bookstore hillside anonymous friend decide spend night bookstore read night browse owner leave lock friend stay bookstore must haunt somehow possessed even really weird first run labyrinth human body part wall make foot toenail animal claw everything red raw smelly plant make human skin body part reason tell friend ignore big deal start rain point take refuge bugler house guy want party want go back human body part maze know happen rap somewhere think within bookstore mall store sort try clothes random man come force give head cry try fight lot big force mouth sputter choke try scream horrible soon run dress room rap multiple way run street bus run seriously felt bus try stop crumple wheel pas bumper scrap chest must lie stomach real life definitely felt physical pressure body find hard breathe think everyone around think dead try figure get rid body know still alive try yell need go hospital one could hear since completely wind friend find back bookstore realize morning try leave owner find u leave saw police car park outside know caught owner stride slowly toward u carry long rifle friend race get around building hide move slowly reason neither u could get go painful watch approach ever close catch u make u get knee hold rifle back head cry plead shoot u distinct think believe rap hit bus go kill one day sob think family middle nowhere man wife save u know owner tell would take u custody house relieve grateful say would anything earn stay house elate rescue well house turn terrible orphanage tell parent die want take care stay ate steam cabbage pasta sauce live small dirty apartment orphan plus friend part keep clean apartment impossible perpetually dirty sex slave man could day later month later hear knock door one morning father master open door father happy try yell owner say pas away shout try draw attention father upset become upset start cry believe owner lie parent die could leave forever reason physically stick make noise horrible honestly think bad combination thing could ever happen happy wake,11.114771,8.94209,844,14,11,10,17,8,10,5,12,26,18,1

She told me the results of an I.Q. test which I had taken in a psychology class. [I really did not take this test.] The I.Q. for this test was 169. She told me that my I.Q. for the test I had taken in the nursing school was only 80. She said that if I had made a higher score in the nursing test I would have received more credit hours for the training that I received from my hospital at home. [I did take a nursing pre-entrance examination. This test determines the number of credit hours that a nurse receives for her student training when she enters the graduate school.] Interpretation This dream is probably a form of wishful thinking.

Her picture was above the picture of her brother's bride-to-be who is about twenty-two-years-old. She was also dressed in a bridal gown and veil.  As I was reading the reviews of the wedding, I felt very unhappy because I hadn't been home to attend the wedding. I thought that the wedding was to take place a week later than it did.

I was looking for something very definite, but I wasn't sure of where it was, or what it was. I had to go to another floor, but I was afraid to get on the escalator because it was going so fast. Finally I steeled myself and forced myself to get aboard the conveyance. I was terrified going up at this break-neck speed. Finally I reached the floor above only to find that what I wanted was in reality downstairs. I was distressed at having to go down again, and confused by the milling crowds. Finally, I managed to get away from the crowd back into a deserted dingy corner where a dingy elevator was. I waited for it to come up with some misgivings, because I recalled similar experiences, from other dream situations, in which the elevator fell or went down too fast and made my stomach feel awful. But I had to get downstairs, and this elevator seemed the only way at the moment. I got in when it came and had the same feeling of inexplainable terror as we descended.

662,hall_female,"College women, late 1940s",12,"Code 002, Age 21, 02/10/48","My mother, father, older sister, and I were at a riding academy, negotiating with the elderly farmer and his wife for pony rides. There were several very small ponies grazing nearby, some brown and white and one black and white. As soon as I saw the black and white one, I was very excited and anxious to ride that one. The farmer remarked that we women were wearing dresses, and offered to wash out some old slacks for us to wear. We were reluctant at first, but the wife was so anxious to have us do so that we must finally have agreed. She smiled almost fixedly at us, and I was fascinated by her shiny face and her literally apple-like cheeks, very round and brilliantly red. Then we were riding horses under an archway past the stables. This scene seemed familiar to me. I think I have dreamed this same riding scene before.  Next we were staying at the farmhouse which seemed to be a winter sports lodge. Somehow it fell to my lot to investigate some sort of crimes going on in the lodge. It was extremely dangerous and I felt as though I were constantly in peril. During the course of the investigation, my companion, (I think it was a girl about my own age who was supposed to be a friend of mine, but I can't identify her), and I discovered several human bodies lying on a wide ice-filled ledge jutting from a wall in the basement. I was surprised and a little repulsed at seeing my aged grandfather's body among those there. The arms and legs seem to have been cut off and were wrapped with the rest of the body in a great deal of grayish gauze with only the head protruding. My companion found a female relative of hers there, too, and expressed the same feelings I had. I was puzzled as to how they got my grandfather's body there, since he died and was buried last April.  In the next scene I was in a bedroom searching for ""evidence"" but I don't know what. My companion was with me but I had the feeling she was either not on my side, or just not of any help to me. Just as I was coming out of the room, hurriedly to escape detection, the two occupants came back. They passed me coming out of their room as they went in, but paid no attention to me, as though it were quite natural for me to be there. I was greatly relieved. One of the men was a large, heavy Englishman, slightly more than middle age, and the other, whom I knew to be the brains of the outfit, was the Mickey Rooney type. Somehow, I knew that he was 18 years old. He was very handsome and attractively dressed in light clothes.  In the next scene I discovered the secret. My companion and I were crouching outside the basement window, peering into a large room with rows of tables. Many men worked there, each at his own table, assembling parts of dismembered bodies, and applying make-up to them to prepare them for display. On each table were piled arms, legs, thumbs, and bodies in various degrees of dismemberment. I was at once fascinated and horrified at what I saw, but satisfied with the ""solution."" Interpretation I can't imagine anything more like a radio mystery story. Since these are my favorite radio diet, the dream may mean that I closely identify myself with the heroic radio detectives. I got great satisfaction out of my role in this dream. I was the ""big deal."" There were many people relying on me, it seemed. I was participating in the kind of excitement I never could find in real life, and when I awoke I felt very relaxed and pleased. Answers to questions 2.

663,hall_female,"College women, late 1940s",13,"Code 002, Age 21, 02/28/48","It seems there was some sort of University rally at M--A. building. All the boys and girls were supposed to parade through the building. Before the rally got to the building, several other girls and I went up to the third floor of M-- to explore. It seems we weren't supposed to go up there, according to the rules. We were very surprised to find that the teachers had their offices there. The hall was lined with shelves of books, something on the order of the arrangement of the second floor of the wing. I took several books off a table to put them on the shelf I knew belonged to this particular teacher. (Each teacher had a section where she kept her books.) Just as I was putting the books on the shelf, I noticed that a door at the end of the corridor was ajar and Miss K-- was sitting at her desk, looking at me. ""Those aren't her books. They're mine!"" she said crossly. I quickly put the books back down, and thought I better get away from there before she realized I was there against the rules, and I got into trouble.  The girls with me weren't very important in the dream. About this time, they dropped out of the action. I didn't want to get caught in the rally crowd, for some reason or other. I heard them coming up to the third floor so I thought I would hurry and get down the back way before they got upstairs. There were several stairways at intervals in the hall, and from where I stood, sort of in the middle, I could see them all. People were beginning to come up the stairway I had wanted to escape down. I ran to one of the others, and the same mob was already surging up there, too. It was the same with all the stairways, and by the time I had discovered this it was too late to get away at all, so with a resigned feeling of disgust I allowed myself to be swept along for a ways. It seemed to be a square hall, and we went all around it and then we were to go back downstairs again. As we reached the stairway, I noticed that just at the head of it there was a bathroom. I felt that this was my chance to escape so I ducked in there without anyone seeing me. There was a combination of a clothes chute, dumb waiter, and spiral stairway in the bathroom which I thought it would be a cinch to use for escape.  It was up quite high from the floor and with some difficulty I managed to get my legs into it in preparation to descend. Then it seemed as though it was smaller in diameter than I had first thought it to be, and higher from the floor. I felt trapped. I couldn't get down through the tube, whatever it was, and I was stuck so that I couldn't get back down to the floor. I was getting worried and was trying to think of some way I could get down through that opening. Then all of a sudden I could get out quite easily, and I found, looking down, that from my position I could easily and safely jump to the floor. I was greatly relieved and I jumped down and all my problems seemed to have been solved. Interpretation My situation of being stuck and having several alternatives, not knowing what to do reminds me of the situation I was in the evening before I had the dream. I came home in quite a confused mood after being almost stranded in a strange neighborhood, trying to call a cab from a neighborhood bar and being stopped in my purpose by a local hoodlum, and finally a male and a female friend of mine showing up with a car and taking me home. I was quite upset when I went to bed, and I think this may account, in part for the dream. Answers to questions 2.

664,hall_female,"College women, late 1940s",14,"Code 002, Age 21, 03/01/48","I walked into a tiny picturesque blacksmith shop and there, at a large table, the blacksmith and his wife were shoeing a tiny white donkey. I knew it was a donkey although it was no bigger than a fox terrier. It was lying flattened on its stomach, front legs out front, hind legs out back. The blacksmith's wife was holding his head while the blacksmith held one dainty hind foot between his thumb and forefinger and filed the shoe around the edges. I talked to them, and noticed that the blacksmith had a handful of tiny horse shoes similar in size and shape to copper pennies with a horseshoe-shaped rim around them. Then I saw a rather large two-wheeled cart standing next to the donkey. ""Does he really pull that?"" I asked, and they answered proudly, ""Oh, yes, all the time."" I felt sorry for him, having to pull such a large wagon, but I just said, ""Isn't that remarkable.""  The blacksmith was very nice. He led me into the adjoining barn where there were larger white donkeys, saying, ''I'll tell you the story about why these white donkeys wear shoes."" The barn was sweet and pleasant, and the animals had very human expressions on their faces. I had a very comfortable feeling of being glad to be there hearing the story. I felt as though I had gone back to live in a fairy tale. The story started to be very interesting. It would have been a wonderful story, I am sure if I could have heard it. Just as it was begun, however, my mother was waking me up. I was very disappointed at having to awaken. Interpretation One of my friends who helps keep me supplied with dreams was telling me her dream about a tiny horse the day before I had this dream. It struck us both as very funny as she told it, and we laughed a good deal about it. This may have had something to do with why I dreamed about a miniature donkey.

665,hall_female,"College women, late 1940s",15,"Code 002, Age 21, 03/01/48","Joe Louis was at my house. It seemed as though he was playing an engagement here as a trumpet player. He sat in a familiar chair in my living room and played hot trumpet music. Our front door was open and there were a great many people on the front porch and in the front yard who had come to see and hear him. I sat opposite him and became more and more interested in him. I decided that, since there was some place I had to go after his performance, I'd promote things so that he'd take me. He kept looking my way and smiling and I felt greatly encouraged. All of a sudden a young colored girl hurried through the room and upstairs to remove her hat and coat, casting a coy glance at Joe as she passed. I wondered whether it was his wife or his girl. He turned to me and said, half to me, half as though he were talking to himself, ""At last she came to see me! I didn't think she would, she hasn't come for so many of my shows, but now she's here!"" I looked at hlm and saw that his eyes were brimming with tears. I was very surprised to see evidences of such deep emotion, and also considerably crestfallen because that ended my chances. Interpretation My girl friend and I had previously been discussing race relations. She is taking a sociology course concerning the Negro, and we had considered gleefully the sensation we would create among some other of our friends if we should take to dating Negro men.

666,hall_female,"College women, late 1940s",16,"Code 002, Age 21, 03/03/48","I was with my family and some friends in a car parked across the street from the little church I used to attend. We had been somewhere and were on the way home, but why we parked there, I don't know. The general atmosphere in the car seemed to be strictly inharmonious. I was out of sorts because I was the only one there without a date, and I sat slouched down in the corner of the front seat. My mother, father, older sister were there, together with several couples of my friends whom I am unable to identify. It seems there were some dishes down in our church basement which I had mentioned a dislike for at one time. I had mentioned this unthinkingly in a casual manner to a character with whom I had gone out several times. He is a couple of years older than I am and has a friend of the same age who acts as his stooge, humoring along his boorish tendencies, and laughing at his jokes: generally, stooging for him, although he's a little less ignorant. All of a sudden, I saw this fellow, together with his stooge and the latter's wife (he's not married really, and the man in the dream didn't look like him, but I knew it was he), come out of the church basement carrying piles of these dishes and laughing loudly and hysterically. They crossed the street and came over in front of our car. Then my ""friend"" started to put on his act. He would hold out a dish at arm's length and with a deliberate gesture, drop it on the ground and let it break. He had different ways of breaking them. Some he dropped in this fashion and others he crushed in his hands, still others he tossed in fancy ways before he let them break. I was utterly revolted that he could think up such a thoroughly stupid thing to do. I was completely disgusted, and tried to pretend that I didn't see him so that he would go away. I think the other people in the car were amused, and laughed every once in a while. He laughed hysterically as he performed, calling, ""Look -- look!"" I slouched down further in the corner of the seat, but I couldn't help smiling every once in a while. I don't know why because I certainly didn't think he was funny. Interpretation Although I have dated this man several times, I think he is an utter character. I spend my time avoiding him now. This act I dreamed of his putting on is just the sort of thing he would really do to attract my attention, or try to get my favor. I have a few facts that might in some way explain the dream. One, he is of a radically different religion from mine, and we don't see eye to eye at all on this score. This may have something to do with the setting of the dream near the church. One time when I was with him, I casually admired a lovely cigarette ease in a jewelry store window, and he went down and bought it the next day for me. This case reminds me of the casual mention of not liking the dishes prompting him to break them all to win my favor. Then, of course, there is Freud's interpretation of breaking dishes. I find it rather difficult to apply this to my dream, however. Answers to questions 2. I felt disgusted and revolted throughout the whole dream.3. Participant4. Unpleasant5.

667,hall_female,"College women, late 1940s",17,"Code 002, Age 21, 03/27/48","I had some sort of report that it was very important for me to give to our family doctor, an elderly man whom, incidentally, I do not like. I looked out of the living room window and saw him driving slowly by in a car with two other people, a man and a woman. I ran out to him with several papers (my report--it seemed as though it was some sort of progress report on my own condition) in my hand and caught up with him a few doors down the street. I felt very kindly toward him, and very glad to see him, just the opposite as I should feel in real life. The man with him in the car was a man who lives in my neighborhood and whom I have seen many times, but whom I do not know by name. He is older than I am, but I do not think he is thirty yet. The woman was no one I knew, and she was not familiar to me in the dream. It seemed as though the man knew me very well, but I was quite surprised to find him so cordial and interested in me when I didn't even know his name. He sat very close to the old lady with him, and once said something affectionate to her and kissed her, at which she giggled. At first, I thought this most unusual that so young a man should be with an old woman, but no more I had thought that when I ""realized"" that it must be his mother. I was very satisfied with that explanation. Then the doctor started to drive the car in the opposite direction from where it had been facing, and about two doors down from my house on the other side, I saw several people coming out. First, was a girl whom I recognized as a girl I went to junior high school with, who had been a very good friend of mine. It didn't look like her, but I knew that it was she. Then a young man came out, following her to the car, and I thought he looked vaguely familiar, concluding that it was J--, the boy L-- had a crush on in Junior high school. I wondered whether she had finally been successful in winning him, and projecting forward in some way, asked someone later about it who told me that they were now married, after many troubles and separations. I felt very pleased about this, and remarked about it to my companions. I felt as though my faith had been restored in human nature. Interpretation Free associating, I can get a few ideas. The man in the car was blond, as was a man I had a date with Thurs. Having a reputation of a cynic, his liking me was a great surprise to me. Ages and birthdays came into our conversation, and I found I was 2 months older than he. That may explain the old woman and young man. I can also tie in the thought of finding something finally after trials and tribulations, as L-- did in the dream. In connection with the first thought, I might mention that I knew this date of mine previously, but had never dated him before. When I really talked to him, I found that he was a very different person from what I had assumed him to be after taking in all the things I had heard about his cold cynicism. The more I free-associate, the more I feel that this explanation has much to do with the dream. Answers to questions 2. Puzzled at friendliness of man. Surprised at his being with old woman.

668,hall_female,"College women, late 1940s",18,"Code 002, Age 21, 04/23/48","I was coming home from work with two people. One was an older woman whom I believe is somewhere in her fifties, a very active person who, somehow, always seems to me much like my mother. The other person seemed to have been another of my co-workers (the older woman being a woman with whom I work at a department store), although I never did actually establish who it was. It seems to me as though it was supposed to be a boy acquaintance of mine, someone with whom I used to go to school a number of years ago and whom I haven't seen for several months because of the fact that he is in the navy. He is about six months younger than I am. As we came out of the store I was aware of the definite need not to look directly at this third person. I thought, ""I don't want to give him the satisfaction that I am being eager."" When we got outside, we boarded a conveyance: a sort of flat cart on wheels drawn by a horse and driven by a coachman seated high in front. The older woman and I got on one side, and the other person, who I almost subconsciously sensed to be this boy, got on the other side, with his back to ours. I again was very careful not to turn around so that he wouldn't think that I was looking at him. I thought, ""It certainly will be wonderful to tell everyone when I get home that I actually rode in one of these things."" For this brief instant it seemed that we were in a strange city or country. Then I began to feel uneasy about getting home. We had to sit very carefully so that we didn't get jarred off the cart as it bumped down a steep hill. All of a sudden the woman jumped off, saying, ""Oh, my goodness I must have forgotten my glasses. I'll have to go back to get them I can't see a thing without them."" And she began to search through her pockets in a distressed manner while following the slowly moving cart down the street. I had a sinking feeling at the thought of having to turn back to retrieve the glasses, and sort of hoped that she would go back alone if she had to get them. But she didn't--she was running along behind, trying to catch up with the wagon, although it was going very slowly. Incidentally, I'm sure she had her glasses on, I remember noticing them, but just didn't feel like telling her, I guess. I figured if she said she forgot them, then she did. Another thing I remember was wondering, shortly after we got on, how we would manage the matter of the fare--concluding that we would undoubtedly each pay a part of it. Interpretation I can't offer any interpretation for this dream. I an of the opinion, however, that these people are really supposed to stand for others, because of their remoteness to me. I have no particularly strong relationship to either of them, and seldom do they cross my conscious mind. Answers to questions 2. The whole trend of events in the dream distressed me immensely.

669,hall_female,"College women, late 1940s",19,"Code 002, Age 21, 04/27/48","We were at a large gathering. It may have been lunch time at school, but it seemed to be more of a party. I guess just about all my girl friends were there. I recognized many of them, but I can't recall who most of them were. I don't remember whether there were any men present. One girl was walking around blinking her right eye and looking quite miserable. I recognized her as a girl whom we try to escape at lunch every day at school. She's quite repulsive, and none of the girls care to have much to do with her. In my dream, no one was paying any attention to her as usual. I asked her what was wrong, and she said that she'd had something in her eyes for days. She was working at it with a bobby pin and I immediately realized this was very unsanitary, so I offered to get it out for her. I pulled down the lower lid and saw a tiny black speck in the corner of the eye. I decided first I'd need a toothpick, but thought, but there aren't any around here, with a feeling almost of panic. Then I remembered having seen some somewhere, and found them in a very unusual place, on a shelf where I would never expect to find them. They seemed to pop up there just because I needed them. I had the feeling that I was very triumphant. I felt almost as though I had worked magic. I took several out of the box they were in, and put one in my mouth because I felt that after all, that was where toothpicks belonged. Next, I needed some cotton, and that turned up in much the same way as the toothpicks had. I felt the same way about finding that. I also felt pleased with myself because I was being so benevolent to this character. I didn't waste any love on her, to be sure, but I felt that I was at least doing my moral duty which was more than any of the other girls were doing. Interpretation I can't offer any interpretation, because I can't think of any possible connections between the dream and anything which happened on the previous day or any other time.

Their parties are quite famous, and so are they personally, as definitely extra-special. I met them almost two years ago, about four months before I broke up with my ""steady"", and after that, I began to be considered as part of the club's gang of boys and girls. All the boys were at the party in my dream, and all their regular girls whom I know so well. I was having a wonderful time, and felt so happy as to be almost floating on air. All of a sudden, in a very natural way as though it weren't unusual, in walked my ""ex"". I was so happy to see him that I almost ran up to him and threw my arms around him. But I didn't. I greeted him and felt gratified that he was very friendly and held no grudge. (This would be very unlike him in real life, I'm afraid.) We sat down together on a davenport in the middle of the long, smoke-dimmed room. Just before he (""Ex) came in, the boy who brought me to the party left with his best friend, also a member of the club and a good friend of mine. They were going out to buy more supplies for the party. The fact that my date would come back and find me with this strange man didn't seem to worry me at all. All I could think about was how happy I was that he had come to the party. I was just dying to introduce him to all of the people there. I said, ""I'm so glad you've come back, because now you can meet all my wonderful new friends, and I can share them and these good times with you."" Then I thought I'd better ask him how he happened to come there. He held my hand and looked seriously into my eyes and said simply, ""I came back because I still love you."" I was so thrilled and so completely happy that I woke up. Interpretation This sounds like wish-fulfillment to me. I have thought so many times since I have met the club how much he would enjoy the people. At times I have thought, ""I'm having such a good time at this party (or picnic) but it needs only one thing to make it perfect--"". In my dream I got the one thing that made everything perfect.

They disclosed to my slyly that the time had now come for me to meet ""the real John Doe"" (the boy). I was mildly surprised to learn that this boy whom I had thought I knew so well was only taking the part of the real one. I was mildly interested in knowing what the ""real John Doe"" was like. At no time were my emotions about any of this very strong. I was only mildly affected by the strange happenings. On the way to the Real John Doe's house they told me that I would like the real one much better. Finally, we arrived and went down to the basement where he had his darkroom. The boy I know is very interested in photography, and the scene was familiar to me as being in his home and just the way we have gone down to inspect his darkroom in real life. When we got down into the basement, there was this ""real John Doe"" absorbed in his photography work. The one whom I had known as John said dramatically to me, ""THIS---is the Real John Doe!"" We said ""how-do-you-do?"" and he immediately began to tell me why his identity had been hidden from me. I thought it was all very nice, but it didn't surprise me that the real John expected the false John to do a fadeout. No one seemed to be surprised by anything. The real John had some of the same physical characteristics as the one I had known, but there was no mistaking one for the other. The real one seemed to be milder and kinder and had the look about him that would make people say at first glance, ""My, isn't he a nice boy!"" That was how he differed from the false John. Interpretation This sounds very much like an actual experience changed around so that the main person is different. My girlfriend had a boyfriend whom He both admired because he was so different from other ""angle boys"". He was so completely unemotional for five months while dating her that we had begun to believe he was that way naturally. Then one day our faith in human nature was shattered. We found he was just the opposite of what we had believed him to be. We expressed this fact by saying that we had now an acquaintance with ""the new -----.

672,hall_female,"College women, late 1940s",22,"Code 002, Age 21, 05/13/48","I decided to get married so I did. That was just the way it happened, almost as though one minute I was single and the next married. Then I began to have qualms about what I had done so impetuously. I thought, ""But I don't even know this man. Here we are married, I'll have to live with him the rest of my life, and what if I find out he's not what I want in a mate?"" Then I thought, ""I can get a quick divorce because we were just married, and no one need ever know"". Then I decided nobly, ""No, you've done this thing and it's up to you to make a go of it. In a few years you'll get acquainted and you can learn to love him"". (Reminds me of the things I have read repeatedly in the lovelorn columns of the newspapers. That's usually the kind of advice they dole out.) Then the man came into the picture. He wasn't bad looking and seemed to be a nice enough person, although he doesn't remind me of anyone. I don't know how I happened to choose him to marry. He seemed almost to not even be aware of our marriage, and to care less. He took the attitude, ""Well, we're married, and I suppose we'll have to stay that way--this is your show, so you call it. What do we do now?"" That was beginning to worry me, too. I thought what will people say when they find out about this? They will expect us to act married, and I can't act married with this man I don't even know. I remember in the beginning of the dream noticing that I had on a cheap engagement ring. It was silver. I thought people might think it was platinum, but anyhow I was glad he had been nice enough to get a sterling silver one. It had been nice on his part since, of course, since he didn't particularly care for me he had not morally been obligated to do anything like that for me. Now the ring had become a plain wedding ring. I remember that we had a conversation concerning our situation. He smirked good-naturedly in an I-don't-care way, and let me know that if I wanted to act married, he'd go along with it, and if I didn't he didn't care either. I practiced calling him affectionate names like ""honey"", but I felt very foolish and uncomfortable doing it. He treated me in the same affectionate way. I was full of remorse for having been so eager, but I thought, well he's a good guy, maybe we can work it out. Interpretation Could be I have been thinking too much lately about getting married, and thinking about it in an entirely objective way, weighing this one against that one. After thinking such cold and calculating thoughts without a qualm, this dream may have come as a manifestation of my inner anxiety over such a course of action. Answers to questions 2.

One of the girls I recognized as a high school and church friend. She was laughing and singing along with the other girls, who were all standing in a circle. The group of girls stood there for a few minutes and then ran away from the building. I then entered a room in which sat my mother, sister, and her little boy. The little boy wanted to sit in a funny little round chair that was very dirty. I went over to a sewing basket and removed a cloth, with which to dust the chair. In the meantime the baby had gotten hold of a pair of scissors, and was cutting something. I took the scissors from him. Interpretation The first part of my dream probably is due to my constant thinking about school, especially now after have attended so many teas this last week, at which so many girls were present. I was recently speaking with the mother of the girlfriend I recognized in the dream. The little baby was probably my little nephew, who lives with us.

At first nothing happened, but gradually snakes began appearing in increasing size and number. The next thing I remember, I was jumping from one table to another trying to escape snakes of all sizes, a good many of them very large. They were coming very close but apparently never reached me as I awakened with no particular feeling of anxiety. The only question left in my mind was how I got away. Interpretation The stimulation for dreaming of snakes may have come from a discussion the afternoon prior to the dream, in a C-- P--class. We were talking about establishing fear responses toward rats and. snakes. I have had a terrible fear of snakes ever since I read Ripling's story of the Cobra, prior to entering Junior High.

I went over to see what he was writing and noted that he was copying word for word the paper of the boy next to him. Knowing that a new rule had just been established that all cheaters were to be reported and that they would be suspended if proved guilty, I determined to turn the boy in. (I have never liked this boy, he is a pre-ministerial student at W-- and is always cheating in tests.) This seemed a good way to teach him a lesson so I typed up the report to hand to the Dean in the morning. The next day I couldn't bring myself to report him but had mentioned it to several people. By noon I heard that most of the class had been reported for a similar offense and everyone accused me of doing it. One of the girls included was a very good friend of mine and I was extremely upset to think that she would think I did it. When the dream ended I was still busy trying to clear myself of the implications. Interpretation The stimulus for this dream no doubt arose from an article I read that evening concerning scholastic cheating and the method of dealing with it which has been recommended, namely the honor system and ensuing reports, on all offenders. As I said the boy in question is a constant cheater and it irks me to think that he not only cheats but is going into the ministry on that basis. I dislike him and often wish he would be caught. I didn't turn in the report because I don't feel that that is the method of cure, and also because I never want to be known as a squealer. Answers to questions 2.

I was solving the problem by carrying the whole dresser into the back seat of the car and then putting in the drawers which were packed with all my things. Later I went off to class, my last one in that school. It was on a second floor of what appeared to be a gym. One wall had large windows in it which were covered by newspapers. A young boy was busy stripping the papers off the windows and when gone we could see into the gym itself. Class was soon over and several of my very close friends and I went downstairs to have a cigarette and discuss the events to follow.

I was to have the honor because I was leaving for another school and they were showing me in this way what they thought of me. My surprise was immeasurable to say the least and I almost cried. The dream ended with Elaine walking me down the aisle to lead the procession. Interpretation Much of the material for my dreams of late has centered about the fact that I just left W.

The object of the game was to jump in the water and pop balloons with a hammer. After watching this I dove into the pool. Shortly afterwards I noticed the pool was empty. The next time I went in there was water in it. Then I took a long run along the side and was in the air over the pool when I noticed it had been drained again. I righted myself and landed on my feet. I remember some feeling of embarrassment for having gone into an empty pool. As I was climbing out I started fussing with an ice cream push cart which had several bowls of sauces at one end.

There were several students, both boys and girls whom I knew, dressed up as the well-known ""keystone cops."" Then there was an old electric car in which sat another male student in an early 1900 costume. Also there was another girl in appropriate costume who kept running back & forth between the car and the policemen always pleading and falling down on her knees.  Eventually I heard a knock on my door and I knew it was my friend. He started to come in and I said ""Wait until I get my pajamas on."" He came in and I was very frightened, for, of course, no boys are allowed in dormitories other than in the main living rooms.  We sat down on the bed and he kissed me. I kept getting more afraid. I told him he would be late to class. So he decided to leave but I didn't know how he would get out without the housemother detecting that he had been in my room.

I don't know who told me the news, but soon after I heard it, the telephone rang and I heard my father's voice. He called to tell me about my mother. When he spoke to me, I felt very sorry for him and suddenly pitied him because he would be alone. When he spoke of my mother, I thought of her and at this point had an intense emotional outburst of tears. Later I remember sensing a fear and dread of going to my mother's funeral. I did not wish to see her dead. I then visualized my mother's face before me with her eyes closed. It was very vivid. Interpretation Here is a classic illustration of the oedipus problem. It is difficult for me to say exactly what this dream means, but it is obvious to me that many of my unconscious feelings toward my parents came out here.

The flrst part took place in the kitchen at home. My mother had bought a new brown leather davenport and I was looking at it and wondering why it was in the kitchen.

There were a great many people standing around however. I remember sitting on the built up stands and watching the skaters go through their various acts. And then the show was over and all the people were slowly leaving and it was getting later and later. I was sitting on the steps that lead up into the coat room. Everyone that went by me seemed to not see me although I was sitting there with no clothes on but some kind of a blanket over me. I remember asking everyone to bring me my clothes so I could go home, but they seemed not to hear me. For some reason I had the feeling that I couldn't move. Finally there was no one around but I still couldn't move. At this point I woke up. Interpretation I have been told that this type of dream where you are out in public without any clothes on and not being able to move, is a very common dream, and I have also been told that it is indicative of feelings of insecurity.

865,hall_female,"College women, late 1940s",215,"Code 033, Age 21, 01//48","As nearly as I can recall, my dream began on an airplane. My companions were students of the same sex, and also a few older women who were apparently our teachers or perhaps chaperones. The interior of the plane was unique in that it resembled a large mansion with an overabundance of large easy chairs. I recall that we were on some kind of tour along the East Coast, with Florida as our ultimate destination. The most prominent thing in my dream to me was the fact that the plane was going by way of Alaska, and that I would have to be on the Plane with all these unliked strangers for days on end. Everyone else was having a good time doing such things as singing, eating, playing cards, and sleeping. I recall that one older woman, the particulars of whom apparently were minor to me, kept pestering me to do things that I had no desire to do. I remember distinctly being afraid to leave my chair or the window for fear the plane would land and I would miss my opportunity to get off and find help. I remember trying over and over again to convince everyone that we did not have to fly the course on which we had started. For some reason I was in a hurry to get back to a certain destination. Neither my home or Florida or any other specific place seemed to be in my dream as where I wanted to be. Occasionally, a familiar person that I liked walked by me, but seemed to be deaf to what I was saying, and apparently they were not conscious of my presence. I can remember distinctly that I thought I was in a world where no one else existed. The last thing before I woke up was that I experienced that falling through space feeling--at which point I woke up. Interpretation My knowledge of the causes and reasons for dreams is practically nil. This dream I remembered the next morning, as if it had actually happened. I gave each part thought, and these are my only results. I dislike flying, although when I have flown, no terrifying thing has happened. Perhaps the fact that my first flight was because of the need to return home from college on my father's death. As for my anger over going such a round about way; maybe that has some relationship for my liking to get places in a hurry for fear of missing something. The sensation of falling through space I have frequently in dreams. I have no fear of high places, deep water, and the like. Some say that that falling sensation may be partially attributed to insecurity of one kind or another. The general restlessness of the whole dream might be tied up with my always present nervousness before exam periods. Answers to questions 2.

866,hall_female,"College women, late 1940s",216,"Code 033, Age 21, 02/13/48","I recall that my dream began with the sensation of getting off a boat. I was laughing at someone in front of me but I do not recall who it was. There was no one else around at that time. The next thing I remember was that I was in some large building of some kind, yet I remember that the building was surrounded by water and that I was walking all by myself through a dark tunnel way of some kind. All of a sudden I ran into a teacher I had. in high school, my chemistry teacher a woman I hated thoroughly. In my dream I was pleased to see her. With her was a girl that I met one summer while traveling. They asked me to get them a radio so they could listen to some music. I told them I couldn't because I was lost and I remember that I was awfully hungry. They told me that there was no food anywhere. I remember that I began to get frightened and tried to run. The door would not open so I ran the other way for what seemed to be hours, and the next thing I remember I was in my living room. Everyone in the room was looking out the windows at a big lake. On it were millions of big boats and they were all on fire. Then I recall trying to get away from the window but a crowd kept pushing me nearer and nearer the burning boats until finally I was surrounded by fire at which point I woke up to find myself standing up against the head board of my bed. Interpretation This dream was just before I got up, therefore it was not a sound sleep. We spend summers on a lake each year, and the night before we had been discussing next summer's plans. The fire, etc., might be explained by the fact that I had just seen a movie in which there was a great deal of fire. Fires always impress me because from the age of one I have been taught the dangers of forest fires in particular, whether the fact that I had eaten a hamburger etc. just before going to bed, has anything to do with my being hungry, is a mystery to me. On the other hand, being a dream near breakfast time, it could. be reflecting my anticipating breakfast. Answers to questions 2.

First I was square dancing on roller skates and found it very difficult to stop. Then I was taking care of a baby who had very bright blond hair. He swallowed something and my mother and I shook him until it came out. We then put him on the porch to sleep in the sun and he turned very tan. He was to be Bing Crosby's fifth son. Suddenly I was at the home of some married friends. Two of our mutual friends arrived, one of whom I dated extensively this summer. I found it necessary to laugh hysterically in their presence. I also urinated in their presence experiencing no emotion while doing so and feeling as if it were a natural occurrence. I then found myself in my own home and my great uncle who has been dead for two years visited us. I asked him why I hadn't seen him for so long, sat in his lap and he stroked my hair as he had done when I was very young. I then watched a boy whom I know only very casually have an epileptic fit--I have never witnessed one in real life. Interpretation The only part of the dream I can attempt to explain is the one in which I urinated in front of the man with whom I was in love and our friend who is at present one of my best friends and with whom I have a platonic relationship. They have both told me that I was inhibiting my sexual desires and afraid of sex. Perhaps I wished to show them that I could be very frank and open about sex.

A car drew up & a man got out. I saw the back of his head which had a round bald spot and thought, ""He must be related to S--."" I have spent several months ""getting over"" S-- and had thought myself well out of the whole affair at the time of the dream. The man came over & spoke to us & he was S--'s brother. I kept making nasty remarks in regard to S--'s forthcoming marriage thinking at the same time, ""Darn! I'm only showing him how much I still care."" I also kept telling him my name & was disturbed that it made no impression on him for S--- had supposedly told his brother all about me, that being the height of the sublime.

I'm very conscious now of my feeling toward him because people talk to me of his engagement & proceed to either watch or question me quite frankly as to my reaction. I think the fact that I dreamed of a brother is significant because I have felt for some time that S--- has an inferiority complex because of his brother who is in the same profession as S--- and is one of the top men in his field.

937,hall_female,"College women, late 1940s",287,"Code 040, Age 20, 03/20/47","A boy named Charles Brown was living secretly in our garage. No one knew he was there & he didn't know that we knew, but we wanted to protect him. A letter for him came to the house and I slipped it under the garage door. It turned out to be new license plates. A colored man came up the driveway while I was standing on the back porch with a girl friend. I pushed her into the house and I too went in and tried to lock the door. It was very difficult, but I finally got it locked. Then I saw a boy I had dated for a long time and whom I had considered marrying. He is now married. He was wearing a very gaudy suit, but it was beautifully tailored. He told me that he was still in love with me before he got married, and in my dream he told me to forget what he had said and that he was really happily married. A younger sister of a M--- acquaintance came into my room and jumped up and down on my toes. I turned her over my knees and spanked her. I went shopping with a girl I dislike. She wanted a mouton coat. They showed her one, and I said, ""That's not an imitation beaver. That's an imitation Persian."" I was to meet my mother and a girlfriend at the H---. My mother--who doesn't smoke--came into the lobby smoking from a long cigarette holder. Interpretation It's difficult for me to find any consistent strain in the various parts of this dream. The boy named Charles was red headed and I've become interested in a red haired boy, if that means anything. I think my old friend's telling me he was happily married is a product of guilt feelings on my part--that he may have married to spite me and that he isn't happy because of me.

I could see myself shifting gears & even said in the dream, ""Now put her in second, now third,"" etc. Interpretation I have no interpretation, but I do wonder about driving. This is the third dream I have had in which I have been driving and shifting gears has been such an important part of the dream.

The rooms were divided by large pillars & we drove right into the house. It was quite a test of driving skill because the pillars were close on either side of the car. I talked to the boy's sister while the others went upstairs to get him. We heard the sound of footsteps outside & looked for prowlers. The wind howled. The boy was just back from the U--- of I--- & said he was D--- C---'s roommate. The sister had red hair & turned out to be only 14 after I thought she was my age. I woke up, looking for & expecting to find a prowler in my room. I went back to sleep & found myself selecting saddle leather handbags. The clerk was a girl who used to work for my Dad & whom I have seen several times recently. All the bags were soiled and marked down. The scene shifted to the dime store where I was selecting jade rings. They must have been made of candy, because I nonchalantly chewed one of them. One was the figure of a Mexican, another a turban-covered face. I was with an older woman I knew but cannot now identify. She was holding my watch for me. It was five o'clock & we couldn't put our call through to Italy since it was three o'clock there, and also because of the telephone strike.

948,hall_female,"College women, late 1940s",298,"Code 041, Age 20, 02/01/48","All I could remember of this dream seems to be very scant. I was riding on a horse in the woods. I was conscious of the green grass and the brown bark of the brown trees. After trotting for a few minutes the horse threw me off his back. I was very frightened and yelled. Before I could do anything else, the horse began to chew my hand. It was very sinister to watch him gnaw at the bones. I woke up as he had chewed half my hand. Interpretation Probably the brown horse was my goal. When he threw me off it probably revealed someone blocked my goal and I became frustrated. Although this interpretation might be far from the point it does seem plausible. Lately I am beginning to feel my goal in life is being blocked. Because all my friends are getting engaged and I am beginning to feel that I will be an old maid. My inability to get a husband will probably result in frustration.  The interpretation of the horse eating my hand is very clear. On Friday, prior to this dream, I did go to the doctor to see about my finger.

These are all my friends. We went to a paladium that looked like the H. Theatre from the outside but had every earmark of H. H. at M. University. We all went in but we found everyone singing instead of dancing. Therefore we all sat down and began singing. My three girlfriends from M. University came in also. C., one of the girls was mad at me because I wouldn't exchange seats with her. A boy, I. was there and he was wearing a blue suit and new shoes.  After the program all the kids came to my house. My dad was home and so naturally I introduced him to all my friends. He was so funny that everyone had a swell time. The dream ended at this moment. Interpretation Since I have many friends it does seem probable to dream of so many friends. The paladium that resembled the H. Theatre as well as H. probably could be traced back to last year. At that time I had a conflicting cholce to make. I couldn't decide if I should go back to M. University (where I spent my freshman year) or enter F. S. M. College.  The change from dancing to singing could be that I recently joined a choir. My interest in music is being stimulated even though I still hold a great interest for dancing.  The reason that I. entered my dream seems due to the interest I held in him last semester. Unconsciously, I am still thinking of him, although not consciously. He always wore a blue suit. The new shoes probably is due to the fact that I went out the Saturday night before with a fella that wore new shoes. It may be probable that I would a man assimilated between these two characters.  I am very used to having all the friends come over my house so this last part of the dream is very real. Although my dad isn't very funny with my friends. He is very friendly but not very funny.

981,hall_female,"College women, late 1940s",331,"Code 045, Age 20, 02//47","This dream was a series of disconnected events, and through its entirety I was strongly aware that I was engaged, and kept constantly twisting my diamond ring around my finger with the thumb of the same hand.  I watched my fiance greet a friend of his by shaking his hand and pounding his friend's hand exuberantly. As a gift, he brought me an expensive pair of eye glass frames in an elaborate glass-case, instead of merely having the frames adjusted, as I had requested. On another occasion, I was sitting on a narrow steel bar about six feet above the ground, discussing my engagement with several friends below me. They later, to my bewilderment, claimed to have known nothing about it, but when I mentioned his name, their enthusiastic replies were how lucky it was that my fiance did not have flat feet! Interpretation This dream, I am sure, is a natural result of a tired, active mind as it works during sleep. There was no organization and comparatively little imagination in it--it is only a slight elaboration and pictorialization of thoughts that had come to my mind during the day. Almost all the details can be matched to actual trends of thought.  Outside factors had probably made themselves felt; the engagement ring in the dream was actually a ring I had found during that day which I had believed lost and which I wore to bed. Perhaps my dream-act of sitting on the steel bar above my friends, however, was a subconscious feeling of superiority to them.  The only person in the dream whom I can actually identify was a friend whom I had seen to talk to that day for the first time in several months.

982,hall_female,"College women, late 1940s",332,"Code 045, Age 20, 02//47","Two girl friends and myself, dressed in bathing suits, entered Hotel C. by the Public Square entrance, and crowded into a self-operated elevator to go to the 10th floor. There was already another person in the elevator, who wanted to get off at the 8th floor. There was some difficulty with the push button, and, after going up, we started to descend again. There was a moment of confusion after which the elevator began its slow ascent again. I had a sensation of claustrophobia.  The swimming pool was in amphitheatre arrangement, with tiers of seats that sloped down to the pool itself. The water, however, looked heavy and thick, and was of a deep blue-green black color, altogether unpleasant. Ahead of my friends, I went down the right aisle to the pool. I started to dive in, but a scream from my friends stopped me; they explained to me that there were five baby pigs at the end of the pool. To get to the other side, it was necessary to go back up the step-aisle and pass in front of the spectators scattered around the ""theatre."" Among them were several boys of my own age, who guffawed loudly at the mistake I had made. With heavy sarcasm and some anger I ""fraw hawed"" back at them. When I had passed, I had the uneasy feeling that they must have thought I was crazy.  At the left end I dived into the pool, and to be sure I did not encounter the pigs, followed a girl in a yellow bathing suit who was swimming in front of me. The pool was divided into several sections by what resembled a clothes rope. I continually entangled myself in these ropes as I tried to swim over them. At this point of the dream I learned that the little pigs were a part of a game provided by the management for its guests; if somebody swam into or near the ""pig pen,"" the crib arrangement in which they were kept would overturn and they would be at freedom in the pool, and swimmers in turn, would be forced to use the pigs' former crib if they did not want to swim with the pigs. Interpretation This dream followed a whole day of intensive study with out a break. I still had not finished my work, however and as I went to bed I worried about finishing it. This may have some bearing on the dream.  The swimming I believe hinges on the fact that twice a week, for an hour or so, I swim at the C. Club. There is a self-operated elevator there, which also has a tendency to get stuck.  The incident of being ridiculed by the boys, I imagine, is my fear of that very thing.  The amphitheatre arrangement may be explained by the fact that I have lately been a spectator myself at several swim meets, looking down from the side to the pool. Answers to questions 2.

I was carrying a flat, blunted rock. My friend stepped down from the path to test the ice in the lagoon, and I realized I was tired of carrying the rock. I let it go, and without my intending it to, it struck my friend in the back. She fell to the ice, evidently unconscious, and a deep, black hole appeared in her back. I had a feeling of horror but helplessness. At this point of the dream events became confused, but when they cleared, I was lying on the path, pretending either that I was ill or had fainted, and several of my friends (girls, whom I remember as knowing but cannot now identify) was standing around me, discussing how I should be punished for having injured my friend. Interpretation To hit my friend with a rock, even if accidentally done in the dream, would probably indicate repressed hostility toward her, although I can think of no reason for that feeling. Pretending to be unconscious, as an escape mechanism, seemed to be a familiar feeling in the dream. Perhaps it stems from an occasion when I was in elementary school, and, being pelted by snowballs from a tomboy school acquaintance, fell down in a snowbank and pretended to have been injured.

Several girl friends and myself were driving home from downtown. I was sitting on somebody's lap and feeling in good spirits; one of the girls, however, was sound asleep, her head resting against a window.  The home at which we arrived was at the top of a hill on a very wooded, mountainous section of Virginia. I was standing on the porch (complete with white pillars) and there was a young soldier with me. I had the feeling he was one of the ""test tube"" soldiers of Ft. Knox; he was very young and wearing a clean, well-pressed uniform, and had red hair. I believe we were waiting for breakfast. He said something to me, and we went to the back of the house. It seems he has wanted to burn rubbish, but the fire had spread to the whole hill, and to hills beyond. There was a great deal of smoke in the air, but I could see no fire.  We returned to the house. In the front center hall, when we entered, was a discussion as to what to do. A woman evidently the owner, decided to open the paddock to free the horses, so somebody, with several dogs, set them free.  In the next action I was a spectator, and the dream took on a motion-picture semblance. The horses were fleeing wildly, and there were several palaminoes I noticed especially. Interpretation All I can really explain is about the soldier and the fire. I had read several articles at that time of the Fort Knox experiment, which interested me.  The fire, I believe, is more important. When I was much younger I used to have nightmares about fire, always in our own home. A fire would start in our attic, I would dream, and sweep thru the house, destroying everything.  This fear of fire I can trace to two sources: first, that my father often became angry with me when he found my toys strewn about the attic, and he often mentioned the possibility of fire. Secondly, for many years our house was next to a wooded, grassy field where field fires in dry summer were a potential danger. My childhood dreams of a fire were very vivid and terrifying and on at least one occasion I got out of bed and went to the attic to see if all was well.  I think probably the above dream was that old fear in a new garb. Answers to questions 2. None in particular3. Both (as defined in dream)4. Neither5.

I dreamed it was a Wednesday afternoon, and I was scheduled to attend two things at four o'clock: a water safety course and a sorority meeting. I decided, however, that I wanted to go home and did so. At six o'clock, however, I was horrified; I had failed to attend a water safety class upon which my summer job depended, and a sense of obligation told me I should have attended the meeting.  Even after I awoke, I felt a sense of anxiety over my escapist action. Interpretation Toward the end of every semester I begin to dream of two things; of cutting classes or forgetting to attend them and being penalized for it and of being unable to remember a single thing on the final examination.  Actually, I have been faced with the above problem of two important activities scheduled at the same time, and my dream decision of chucking the both by at once and deciding to go home, probably indicates wishful thinking of the same.

986,hall_female,"College women, late 1940s",336,"Code 045, Age 20, 04//47","Supposedly next summer, I had returned to the camp where I actually counseled last summer, although it did not in the least resemble that place, but rather my aunt's farm in Virginia, which is in rolling country. There were only four or five of us counselors there and we were to organize a pre-camp training course. I cannot now remember the other dream characters, (although I knew them in the dream) except one who is a friend of mine here at school. It was a very rainy, dark, dreary day when we arrived, and while we were unpacking, when our camp director assigned us jobs and I was to gather firewood, I asked, intending to be facetious, ""dry firewood?"" When the director looked scornful at that remark, I felt ashamed and embarrassed. As I unpacked my unusually large suitcase I discovered at the bottom dozens of candles of all sizes. I did not know why they were there, but realized they would be useful at the ""final banquet,"" a tradition and quite an occasion.  I also discovered many sweaters -- sweaters I have had for years, and I was glad to see them, for I was cold and wet. As I stood there, in my slip, I looked down the hill to the road and saw a man in an automobile driving past and staring up at me. It made me quite angry. Interpretation I have been preparing to return to camp this summer, and during the week of this dream had been busy filling out application blanks and writing to counselors I had known there last year. The directyor in the dream has since resigned and been replaced. The feeling of inadequacy with her I had occasionally felt, but it was not a constant feeling.  Candles seem to be a source of anxiety--for some reason it seems I am constantly having to get them for occasions; parties, concerts, birthdays, etc., and very often have forgotten them or been unable to buy them. They may have represented a feeling of frustration. Firewood seems to be another frustration symbol, for keeping it dry was of prime importance, and I was often mildly bothered about it at camp, fearing it would get wet and we would be unable to have a fire.

As I walked along, one woman said to another (although I was not conscious of seeing either) that mine would have made the sixth abdication in a century. I had a feeling then of belonging to English royalty.  As I went into the street, it was raining, and I had to walk carefully, for it was very slippery. It was at night, and the lights from the shops on the streets reflected on the wet pavement. I began to cry, and a friend of mine came up to me to beg me not to commit suicide. I assured her that I wouldn't, saying that a five-minute walk in the rain would fix me up completely. I then lay down on the pavement and cried and cried. Interpretation My act of abdication produced in me a most intense feeling somewhere between the martyristic and brave ""I can take it"" attitude. My friend who begged me not to commit suicide, I realize, has appeared before in a minor part in a recent dream. I do not know why, for I see her seldom, and am not on intimate terms with her, although we have known each other since kindergarten days.

988,hall_female,"College women, late 1940s",338,"Code 045, Age 20, 04//47","There was a young girl, whom I judged to be about seven years old and whom I felt was a playmate of my sister (although my sister is now sixteen), visiting our house. She was a very ragged, dirty and unkempt child, which bothered me considerably. I took her to her home, which was the lower half of a double house on a street not far from ours, and found the place in a deplorable messy condition. We went through several rooms, all of which seemed to be furnished in living-room style, to the kitchen in the back. The kitchen too, was in an abhorrable state; dishes of food from several previous meals was lying around, which rather nauseated me. Just inside the door of the dining room was the refrigerator (""x""). [There is a diagram in the original dream report.] I peered into it, and the heat from the inside hit me in the face. It was revolting, I thought, to have butter and milk and eggs kept in a warm icebox! The little girl, meanwhile, had been unobtrusively following me around. I thought a splendid thing to do would be to clean the whole place thoroughly, and I had the feeling that by doing so I would greatly impress someone whom I wanted to make a good impression upon.  Evidently we made a good job of it, for the little girl thanked me profusely, and mentioned that her older brothers, as well as the two boys who lived upstairs, would certainly admire me for doing such a good job of cleaning! Interpretation The young girl reminded me of a schoolmate I had in the first year or two of elementary school. She had about the same appearance as my dream child, and although I never knew of her home life, I knew she was one of six children. Often I would bring her home from school to have lunch with me, and once I gave her a penny that my ""boy friend"" had given me. (I had not thought of this for years; thinking about the dream brought back these incidents).  To clean up a place in such a condition as her home was would probably be my natural tendency to do so; perhaps the dream indicates that I really want to be admired for this tendency.

989,hall_female,"College women, late 1940s",339,"Code 045, Age 20, 05//47","I was standing on our upstairs back porch watching some sort of an air show in the sky. Although it was night, I could see a blimp in its entirety, silver-colored, and a legend or advertisement or news bulletins running around it. I squinted and peered to try to read what it was, but could not.  There were several airplanes sky-writing, and doing it in a very graceful sweeps across the sky. I also tried to read what they were writing, but the smoke evaporated or disintegrated before I could read the words.  In spite of all this aerial activity, there was no noise. I then became cold and sat in the corner of the porch, huddled up, trying to keep warm. Interpretation Earlier in the evening of the dream I had seen the Goodyear blimp which has lately been floating over C. at night, flashing news reels along its side in Times-Square fashion, so, obviously, that is where the ""dream blimp"" came from.  My not being able to read it probably springs from the fact that I am near--sighted and would not be able to see it without my glasses. I have noticed in other dreams, however, when trying to read a book the print sort of melts away before I can see what it says.  The sky-writing of the planes, which was fluffy, pastel-colored stuff, may have come from a package of shipping-cream dye I had bought that day.

There was a punch table around which many people were gathered, and groups were standing and walking around, giving an impression of constant activity. This was, I knew, a fraternity social affair. My date, however, seemed constantly to run off, returning later but giving me an uneasy feeling of being left alone. One of his quick trips back to me, he asked ""how's O.?"" and I felt surprised that he should know O.  I met a girl who was also alone, and the two of us went back to an elaborate lounge. After some muddled activity, I was back in the living room of my own home, and the mother of a friend (boy) of mine was asking me to give her a wide silver filigree bracelet that I own. Interpretation In retrospect this dream seems to be confusingly active; the activity, that is, of people constantly milling around. The corridor-like setting seemed very large, but because of the many people, was not vast.  My date, I presumed in the dream, was gotten for me by a friend of mine who is actually in the fraternity, and whose mother it was who later asked me for the bracelet. I do not know how I know it was his mother in the dream, for I have met her but once, and would not recognize her if I saw her again, I am sure.

At an intermission there was some sort of a program in which three girls, dressed in formal gowns, sang, sitting down. They were quite informal about it, giggling and glancing about as they sang. One girl I vaguely know as being in one of my classes, was wearing a yellow formal--the only color in the dream. One of the girls has moved recently to California (the two vaguely physically resemble one another). On the other side of the trio, still another girl (B) got up and left, saying she felt embarrassed because her skirt was too short.  The couple with whom my partner and I were evidently double-dating, was a high school friend of mine who has since married and whom I have not seen since her wedding. As we drove home from the dance my dancing partner changes to a youth whom I have never seen. As he left me at my door in broad daylight, he hastily shook my hand, as I opened the door, and left. My mother was awaiting me at the top of the stairs. Interpretation On the day of this dream I had looked forward to a call from the fellow with whom I have gone rather steadily for several months, realizing that if I did not hear from him, I would probably not see him again.

1025,hall_female,"College women, late 1940s",375,"Code 051, Age 20, 09/25/47","I was in a foreign land living in a strange house with a very blonde girl. All of my friends seemed to live in this country too. There were two troops of soldiers also in the town who were friendly with each other although they seemed to be from different nations. one troop dressed in white uniforms and wore black turbans while the other troop wore khaki. My fiance belonged to the khaki group of soldiers. For some unknown reason the troops began to fight and those in khaki formed two lines--the first kneeling, and the second standing behind them. This made a perfect target for the troop in white, and in the fight my fiance was shot and killed. When I heard, I was grief stricken and especially because I was unhappy living with the blonde girl, and also had received bad news from my mother. The blonde continually stole my potato chips which angered me. The bad news was that my dog was very ill and my uncle had given him a blood transfusion. I was very upset.  Another elderly man had also given blood for my dog although the animal was not expected to live. (My uncle has been dead for about 8 years and he was about 71 when he died. He was not a blood relative, but lived for years with my mother's family and I always called him Uncle. He was very kind to me. The other elderly gentleman I cannot identify. My dog has been dead about 1-1/2 years and was 12 years old when he died. I cannot identify the blonde girl, but She was my age in the dream. My fiance is 23 years old.) Interpretation My fiance is away at school which may account for the foreign place. I may fear subconsciously, that he will be taken from me by another girl--symbolized by his death and my stolen potatoe chips, which in reality I like to eat. Perhaps I look on my mother as a bearer of bad news who adds one trouble to one already established. Answers to questions 2.

I was walking down S--- Avenue at dusk when a colored man jumped out of a doorway and pulled me back into the shadows of a dime store's entrance.

Next I was in a class which was electing some committees. I remember seeing the words, ""Christmas"" and ""Easter"" on the board, and I couldn't see any reason for having to hold the election. We all dropped what we were doing & went outside. There was a beach and a bunch of girls & fellows were either building something out in the water or else were trying to hold a picnic on a sand bar. I seemed to be on the committee for the gathering and was called to the phone. It was some boy's mother, & she kept talking continuously & seemed interested in Boy Scouts. Meanwhile everyone was busy carrying things to the sand bar. By the time I finished talking all the work was done, & I remember going out in a boat with a gang. It was dark and the waves were high. Somehow I found myself in a bedroom which in the dream was supposed to be my girlfriend's bedroom. It was quite cluttered up, particularly the top of the dresser, and I was disgusted with the condition of it. The wallpaper was of huge red rose design. (In reality the girlfriend, who is 20 years old, has an entirely differently decorated room--although she is rather careless with her belongings.) Interpretation Perhaps this dream is concerned with my classes, for the day before I had the dream, I had a speech class & was told I was to prepare a speech for the next meeting. I do not like to make speeches. In another class we elected class officers, and I felt like it was extremely unnecessary to do it in college.

1029,hall_female,"College women, late 1940s",379,"Code 051, Age 20, 10/10/47","My fiance asked me if I minded going to the same restaurant again for dinner. I said it was all right with me. We went down a hilly business section of a small town and in the valley was the restaurant. It was called the ""L--- F---"" or something similar. On either side of the door were scenes from a desert showing cacti and Joshua trees. We went in & sat down temporarily at a table with some strange people. They weren't very congenial, and we didn't like sitting with them, so as soon as an empty table was available, we moved. While we were attempting to order, three older people pushed in on us and sat down at the table too. My fiancee had to sit on the edge of his seat for the woman piled her belongings, especially a big round purse, on his chair. The people were very friendly, but we wanted to eat alone and were quite upset. After eating, we went through a door and walked up an incline inside a building. I waited on the crest of the incline while my fiance went into another room. Soon he & a huge crowd of people swept out of the room. All were dressed as Hollanders and yet spoke Spanish. They were all happy and excited and eager to be on their way. My fiance spoke Spanish fluently with them, and I was perturbed because I could only speak a few words, although I understood them. They were going down to Mexico and were so happy. I remember trying to say in Spanish ""I wish I could go."" I kept saying ""Quiero _______""--can't recall the second word. My fiance stood with me talking to them & I kept saying ""Quiero _______."" Interpretation I can't interpret the beginning of the dream, but perhaps the ending of it symbolizes the desire I have to travel. I spent some time at school in A--- & always have wished to return someday. My fiance & I both plan to go there together. We have both taken Spanish, but not enough to speak fluently.

1031,hall_female,"College women, late 1940s",381,"Code 051, Age 20, 11/01/47","I was in a huge school gym which resembled the one I used for handcraft on a playground while directing this summer. I was wrapping packages and decorating them. Others who I cannot recognize were doing the same thing. We found a decoration for a package which we thought was wonderful and beautiful. It was simply pasting one narrow piece of tape (dark colored) in the middle of a wider piece of tape like this: This was a great idea in the dream. Someone who I was familiar with, but can't recall now, criticized my wrapping and I felt bad and angry too. I also remember placing a candle in each corner of a package for design like this:  I saw the words ""Medicine inside--Handle with care"" on boxes. It seemed to be concerned with the Pharmaceutical Co. my father works for as I talked with his boss. Everyone left except me and I kept wrapping. A colored girl came in to clean and then a colored man. I heard him say to the colored girl that he was going to pick all the pockets of the coats and the pocket books before the people returned to work. I was furious and tried to stop him, but he smiled and pushed me violently away. I forgot to say earlier that in order to wrap the packages we had to lick the tape. It tasted so bad and my mouth became sticky and dry, so that I could hardly swallow. It was awfully frightening and uncomfortable too. Interpretation The gym has been identified. I can't see the significance of the packages, although I had been at my fiance's for dinner and we ate by 4 candles. We mentioned the lovely design reflected on the ceiling. My fiance wanted more light to eat by, so we put on the electric lights. However he had eaten the night before with me at my house by 5 candles and said then that it was fine. We all commented on this. My fiance and I had used my parents' car during the day, and we had to park it unlocked. This worried me as it was loaded with some medicine, and I knew my Dad wouldn't like it if he knew, because of the chance of theft. Perhaps this accounts for the threat of theft by the colored man. As to the dry taste in my mouth, I can't interpret it. I have had this dream of a dry mouth which hinders swallowing and finally leads to a feeling of not being able to get my breath many times. It is always very vivid and frightening. Answers to questions 2. I felt angry and also frlghtened3. Actual participant4. Unpleasant. When it wasn't unpleasant it was void of description or dull.5.

1032,hall_female,"College women, late 1940s",382,"Code 051, Age 20, 11/05/47","I dreamed I was in the upstairs of a double house visiting one of my girl friends. She is 20 yrs. old and I've known her about 10 years. The house was strange. I was afraid of some Indians out in the back yard who were after me for some reason. I was frightened, but solved the problem by having my father (who was evidentally with me) back the car out to the front, and I sneaked out the front door without being seen by the Indians. Next I found myself walking through a department store on the way to an offlce. I stopped and looked at clothes and talked to someone I knew, but can't remember now. I was all dressed up and seemed to be there for an interview for a job. I wore my fur coat, a square fur hat--which impressed me for it was so stylish; and also I wore a silk scarf which I remember. I sat in the office as if I was extremely confident. I talked to a young girl and an older woman sat to one side observing me and taking notes. I seemed to be on a higher social level than either in the office. Interpretation The evening I had the dream I had visited my girl friend with my parents. We stayed quite late, so I had to stay up even later when I got home to finish The Prairie by Cooper, which was due the next day: This book is about Indians and their wars and friendships with white settlers. I was worrled I wouldn't finish the book, but I did. Thus I got away from the Indians. My sister just started working with my girlfriend B. who told me how she was getting along. My sister has had 3 yrs. of college and is now in an office with girls who have had none--thus she feels rather superior to the job as a whole. I identified myself with my sister in my dream, for I'd like to be able to work to have money to buy some clothes, but I can't when I'm in school.

I saw my Aunt sitting on a swing which hung from the ceiling (We do not have any such swing). She had a pair of gold-rimmed glasses on which fitted down over her nose in a peculiar muzzle-like way. I remember particularly a piece of the contraption fitted down the nose, following an indentation between the nostrils, like this. In a wicker stand were some plants which we were admiring. All at once the plants heaved upward, and a pig emerged oinking loudly. We all laughed and thought the pig was darling. We became very attached to the animal. Interpretation My Aunt has a slight dimple in her nose, but nothing compared to the one in the dream. I can't figure out why she would be wearing such glasses or what it would symbolize.

We left almost at once as if the play were over. We walked down many, many stairs which were covered all the way down with an awning of green stripes.

I remember seeing that everything in it was pink, and it seemed to be long and very narrow. In the dream I found that my sister had a room on the fourth floor which was very huge and done up completely in green. I walked from room to room on the fourth floor, and found that many of my old friends were living in them. Who these friends were is a bit hazy now, but they were people I knew a long time ago.

A friend of mine was standing at a desk, and presently she came over to me with something hidden inside her coat. It turned out to be chocolate, eggs, sugar, and all the ingredients necessary to make fudge. We ran upstairs with these things hidden. The building then seemed to be built like A Hall, and it seemed that we climbed about six flights of stairs. On the top floor we found there was a radio broadcast going on, so we had to sneak down again. There seemed to be about fifteen girls mingling around who eventually began to chase us. This is all I recall, except that at the end the ingredients were combined and we were running with a pan of fudge. Interpretation I often have a desire to make fudge around home, especially when home alone, I usually don't tell my folks when I make it, and perhaps that accounts for my trying to hide it in the dream. My first class at Reserve is in A. on the third floor, and perhaps this accounts for the climbing of stairs. As for the radio broadcast and the group of girls, I can't quite figure that out.

1059,hall_female,"College women, late 1940s",409,"Code 053, Age 21, 07/08/48","This dream seemed to be especially long, and especially realistic. After I awoke I realized how absurd it really was. It began on a boat where someone had been murdered (a male). The murderer had wrapped a snake around the victim's neck. I was suspicious of a tall, dark, young man, who was not good looking but had a beautiful build. As I recall, his name was Wade. However, after I got to know him we fell very much in love, and combined our efforts to find the murderer. The next thing I recall is that we were walking down a road to a farmhouse. Someone there told us to follow a road to find the murderer. We walked down the road, and soon Wade was far ahead of me. The road divided and it seemed to be very misty. I couldn't find Wade. There were millions of people walking down the road and I passed a young fellow who had been on the boat. I asked him about Wade and he said he had just been killed. I came to a hurst with two policemen in it. There were curtains drawn all the way around it, and the policeman peeked through and said Wade was dead. I cried through the rest of the dream! I then came to in an airplane filled with tunnels and people. I overheard the pilot telling the murderer he would conceal the murderer in the wing. I then realized the murderer was the young man who had told me Wade was killed. My father then advised and I told him where the murderer was. This is the last I recall. Interpretation The only connection I can make to this dream is my worry about my boyfriend being short! (about my height) The prevalent thing in the dream was that Wade was tall. When I awoke I felt as though I had been crying all night. It took a long time to get this dream out of my mind. No one in the dream was familiar to me, except my father. I had never seen Wade before. The murderer wore a plaid sweater and was a good friend. I told my father who he was because I felt revengeful about Wade's death.

The building resembled an apartment, but the bottom floor was a huge mansion in which I lived. I saw two girls I knew, both named Virginia, and was talking to them through the window. I suddenly realized that I had missed a girlfriend's wedding, in which I was supposed to be a bridesmaid. The wedding took place at 9:45. I ran downstairs, and suddenly our basement was composed of many long tunnels with wooden posts, cobwebs, and insects. It resembled a mine and had many rooms off of it. I was with my freshman year roommate at college, and we were being pursued by an invisible worn! My roommate said something which angered the worm, and the next thing I knew she was being cut by a razor blade! I recall seeing scratches on her face and blood coming from there.

Much of my dream seemed to be composed of an argument I was having with my mother. She wouldn't allow me to go in the plane, and it seemed to have something to do with the kind of shoes I had on! She told me that if I went I would be killed. I remember feeling that I was being persecuted, and my sister was allowed to go while I wasn't.  Suddenly the scene changed and I was at college at M. University. I was walking on the fourth floor of a dormitory, and the floor was broken up into big pieces which were revolving. Someone came up to me and asked me who turned on the switch to have the floors revolve. This was connected with the airplane ride, as someone said that the reason the floor was revolving was because there was an airplane someplace near by. Interpretation The dream seems to indicate a feeling of my sister's preference in the family. The friend of my sister's was a girl who I have not seen or thought of for years. The dominance of my mother in the dream relates to reality, for she is always the disciplining factor in the family. The revolving floors might show a feeling of insecurity or fear of rejection.

The only incident I recall is that I was angry and in this anger the only way of release that I seemed to have was to squash slices of ripe tomatoes over the parts of the machine which stuck out. This act seemed to be a retalitory act. Interpretation I do not have a definite interpretation of this dream. I can associate the tomatoes with the fact that I have always enjoyed eating raw tomatoes but why they would appear in an unpleasant dream is not clear to me.

1068,hall_female,"College women, late 1940s",418,"Code 059, Age 23, 10/06/47","Setting- our pond at home, it was late fall, the trees were all bare and it was cold outdoors.  Characters -five men who were strangers. I was not able to distinguish them as to age but they appeared to be dressed as business men.  Action - A glider plane landed on the water close to the dam. The landing seemed to be smooth but actually it was a forced landing. I recall seeing the ship sink slowly in the water but recall no action until I saw the five bodies, in miniature size, lying together in the bottom of an ordinary pail. I did not question the fact the bodies had suddenly became so small and know of no reason for it. I was alone watching this action from a distance but later when I saw the bodies' our St. Bernard dog was with me. I experienced no dread, only surprised wonder and sadness. Interpretation I enjoy flying a great deal and for this reason the appearance of a plane is not novel to me. I must have gotten my ships a little mixed up though, for while the action of a ship landing on our pond is not new, since it occurred last year in the late fall, the ship was a heliocopter, equipped for amphibious landings. I was not at home when this occurred and was very disappointed about it, so it would seem that even though I was unable to place myself in the dream as a passenger at least I had the satisfaction of being able to see it. However, the feeling of sadness which I experienced upon the realization that people had been drowned in our pond is directly related to by conscious feeling of fear that someone, some day, may drown in our pond, for at its deepest end it is approximately 15 feet deep. The presence of strangers is most likely a manifestation of the new groups of people I have met here at W.R.U.

Characters -my father and brother, 2 student waiters, several old women and an average restaurant crowd.  Action - I had planned on meeting my father and brother (who is in the Navy now but was a civilian here) at this restaurant. I spent a good deal of time looking for them among the crowd but finally found them. Then we sat down to eat but had to wait a long time until a waiter promised to take our order. I recall that there were two student waiters who were very busy taking care of serving several older women. Sometime during the action, I recall bumping into the waiters and having to excuse myself. I recall no other action but I do remember experiencing frustration when I was unable to find my dad and brother and even greater frustration when we were unable to get the waiter to take our order. Interpretation I interpret this dream as a manifestation of my desire to have my brother at home again and in a more broad sense my desire but my seemingly impossible hope of making my father look with less cynicism and distrust at the general topic -college. In this dream I seemed to have failed in that endeavor again although I recall nothing of my father's reaction. The entire situation was not a favorable one for my point of view. The presence of men student waiters is most likely an unconscious association with a student who I have met here who waits on tables.

I remember taking an escalator to the 2nd floor and meeting a girl on the escalator. I told her to wait for me. When I got to the 2nd floor, I opened the door to my room and discovered it was a classroom. I was very confused. I tried some of the other doors on the floor, but they were all locked. I decided to take an elevator down to the first floor, but here the dream gets rather confused. I seemed to be swinging through hoops. I remember thinking it was like some ride at E. Beach. Interpretation This dream took place shortly before school started, which explains its content. The reference to 7:30 is easily explained as I intended getting up the next day at that hour to attend an activities program for new students. My mayor is Spanish. I had been a little worried about how well I'd do this semester, because I'm transferring from 0. During my two years stay there I lived in a dormitory.

1086,hall_female,"College women, late 1940s",436,"Code 064, Age 21, 09/21/47","I dreamt that my 19 year old brother and I had just left our house and were walking down our street. From a distance we saw two people (don't recall sex) on the corner. They seemed to be looking for someone to antagonize. It did not occur to me that we would be the unfortunate ones. When they saw us they began to throw sticks and stones at us. We turned back and started running down the street. We crossed the street and went through an open gate in a backyard (unfamiliar to me except that I seem to have seen this gate and yard before in my dreams.)  We ran on for what seemed close to an half hour. Then we reached a side street and stopped--assuring ourselves that we were no longer being pursued. The street seemed to be in the neighborhood of S C Ave., which is about 20 blocks from my home. I asked my brother if he wanted to take a cab home and then before he had replied, continued that I thought we would be safe on a streetcar. At that moment my parents came into view. They had both very obviously been drinking and were tottering on their feet and grinning stupidly. My mother said that she had had ten drinks. Our car was parked on the side street and we decided to go home. We got into the car and just before we left a policeman came up and gave us a ticket for parking in front of a fireplug. We drove up to 1 st. and started down when I realized all of a sudden that we were in the midst of a parade. All the paraders were colored people. They began shouting that we could not ride in their parade. Interpretation I believe the reason my brother entered the dream is that he has been overseas for 1 1/2 years and I have been anxiously looking forward to his return this fall. I had this dream two days after I saw the movie ""G."" Being of the J faith it naturally made a deep impression on me. Although I had never experienced any real difficulties because of my religious views, the picture brought out to me the many humiliating experiences which others of my faith have undergone. The whole issue of anti-semitism in the movie began with the invitation of Mr. S  (a J) to his apartment of some soldier's saying: ""What is the matter? D'ya think we're not good enough to drink your stinking liquor?"" The number ten may have arisen from the boasting of one of my young friends on the Saturday before my dream that he had consumed 10 bottles of beer at a picnic. The amount he had consumed greatly astounded me at the time. I cannot explain the fact that both my parents were drunk, as both drink very little. The difficulty we experienced with the policeman may have been due to the parking difficulties we have had of late. With reference to the parade of colored people, their place in my dream is probably due to the fact that we live in an almost entirely colored neighborhood and have been attempting unsuccessfully to find another house into which to move.

1087,hall_female,"College women, late 1940s",437,"Code 064, Age 21, 09/30/47","In my dream I am in a two-room doctor's office. The doctor's sex seems to fluctuate between male and female. There are two other patients in the office. One of the patients is my cousin (a girl of 23), the other a middle-aged woman unknown to me, accompanied by her two children. The doctor examines the middle-aged woman and tells her bluntly she has cancer of the pancreas. He then examines my cousin and tells her she has cancer of the breast. My cousin burst out crying and ran into the next office. The rooms of the office are doorless. The doctor examines me and makes no comment. I go to the next room and see my cousin. She is holding a ring box and crying. A woman is combing her hair and comforting her. The middle-aged woman offers to drive the doctor (now a woman) home. The doctor asks the woman if she will also drive me home and she hesitatingly answers in the affirmative. It seems that she and I live in the same neighborhood. She drops us off at the corner of my street. Interpretation The doorless two-room office, I believe, may have been brought to my mind by the voting booths. I had noted for the first time that day and it left a deep impression on my mind. There has been a great deal of publicity of late with regard to Cancer Clinics, and I think the middle-aged woman in my dream symbolizes my aunt, who died of cancer two years ago. She, also, had two children. By cousin's presence may be accounted for by the fact that I am to be a bridesmaid at her wedding next month and have been very excited at the prospect. The ring box symbolizes her approaching wedding as does, I believe, the combing of her hair as if getting ready for the wedding. The voting booth was on the corner and I believe this fact corresponds to the last phase of my dream. The doctor, now, may be identified with my girlfriend--with whom I went to vote.

I recognize both of them as being co-workers of mine when I worked for the MMC three years ago. Another woman (just a blurred image) is dictating to one of the girls. She seems to be worried because the mail had not yet arrived. I go down to the basement of the building and look in my box. ""I find two notes. The top seems to be located in M A, but is on the wrong side of the hall. The notes seem to deal with some papers which I forgot to turn in at the bookstore. I am extremely puzzled. ""How could I have known about those papers when I am not a Mstudent, "" I say to myself. As I am standing by the box I see my cousin (a married man of 29) put a note in his sister's box. (She is 31 and does not go to M.) I then go to the bookstore which is also in the basement. I am told it is the wrong one. I go upstairs, still in search of the bookstore and meet my S prof (the one I had at OSU.) I seem now to be at 0. S. U. He asks me why I returned and I explain that I am no longer going steady. At this point my dress blows up and I have difficulty holding it down. Ask him to help. We admit that teachers seem to get along better with pupils in class than out. I walk away. Interpretation The two-room office here represents my advisor's office. I had been in to see her the previous day. The women from W. M. C. were probably brought to my mind because I saw one of them downtown recently and it had been a long time since I saw anyone from the office. The note I found in my box corresponds to the one I received from my advisor. She had advised me that through error, I had been placed in a class for which juniors were not eligible. She said she had not known about it (which corresponds to my statement that I could not have known about the papers.) My cousin probably entered my dream due to the fact that I was worried about him. I had heard that day that he was having marital difficulties and that his family (represented by his sister) were very perturbed. I cannot account for the presence of my S Prof. in my dream, nor why I should again be at OSU. The episode of the dress is equally unaccounted in my mind.

1089,hall_female,"College women, late 1940s",439,"Code 064, Age 21, 10/17/47","I am seated in a classroom. It is a course in Beginning German. Our teacher is a woman (face unfamiliar). It is the first day of class. The teacher is speaking to us in German. (I don't understand her.) All of a sudden we see a man running past the window. He is carrying books. The teacher attempts to attract his attention, but fails. He comes into the classroom a few minutes later, wearing a shirt. I seem to recall that he wore a baby's bonnet on his head. He takes these clothes off or, at any rate, I later recall him as wearing a business suit. His features are very clear (face unfamiliar to me). I particularly notice that his teeth are not nice. He and the German prof. discuss the possibility of opening up another German class. The teacher again talks to us in German. The words are very long. I do not understand her. The young man leaves and says goodbye to us all. (Forgot to mention that I laughed almost hysterically when he came into the room. I remember the tears rolled down my cheeks.) In the second part of my dream, I seem to be near a football field. I am looking for my boyfriend, but cannot find him. The scene changes to the lounge of the dormitory at O. S. U. I am sitting on a striped-chintz love seat. My housemother comes into the room (aged 60). At the same time I see a girlfriend of mine being helped into a car. Someone says she is being taken to the Dean's office. My housemother approaches and asks me for my notebooks. She says the Dean is looking through all girls' notebooks to see if they have loud sentences written in them. I give her all but my psychology notebook which I fear may have some obscene words in it. I look through it, but find nothing. I see my boyfriend (age 20) and tell him what happened. He tells me he thinks they were wrong for doing it. The third phase of my dream took place in my living room. My boyfriend and I are seated on the couch. He attempts to kiss me, but I feign indifference. He calls my bluff and we kiss. Interpretation The episode in the German class can probably be explained by the fact that my boyfriend is taking German and experiencing difficulty with it. I remember telling him that I wish I knew German so that I could help him. I attempted to test him on a vocabulary list and we both laughed heartily over my pronunciation. The unusual costume of the head of the German Department brings to my mind the costumes sported by freshmen women the first week of school. The second phase of my dream would seem to represent my guilt feelings concerning sex. Of late I have noticed that my mind is frequently preoccupied with the subject of ""sex"" I have felt that my preoccupations were unhealthy. The episode of the psychology notebook escapes me. The third phase probably represents just plain wishful thinking. I hadn't kissed my boyfriend in a few days and was looking forward to it. I probably feign indifference to get back at him for not having kissed me. Answers to questions 2. Happy, excited.3. Participant4. Pleasant5.

Her gown catches on fire. My girlfriend and I hasten toward an open window and jump out. The room we had been in was devoid of furniture. (Not too sure of last statement.) We quickly run around to the front entrance. We go into a large room. I see a handful of people sitting on what appear to be shoe-shine chairs. Their heads are all bent down and they appear to be very sad. I recognize my father. I seem to recall that some of the others were also members of my family, but I couldn't remember specifically who they were. Someone tells me that some of the members of my family are missing. Interpretation This dream has little meaning for me. The only connection I can make with the hotel room is that my boyfriend and I have a standing joke about making a reservation at the S-- hotel, ""just to sleep together nothing else."" The girl in my dream used to go steady with my boyfriend, but is now married. It was she who introduced us. Perhaps this dream symbolizes the family disapproval with which our indiscretion would be met. Yet, this interpretation seems hard to accept, as we have never seriously considered transgressing. I suppose I must confess to being extremely curious of ""what it would be like."" Maybe the dream represents a conflict between my unconscious desire to have intercourse and a strict superego.

1092,hall_female,"College women, late 1940s",442,"Code 064, Age 21, 10/29/47","I find myself in a small kitchen. It seems to be on the second floor. My cousin, girl age 19, is with me. We decide to go for a walk. As we are walking we pass a large field. A wedding seems about to take place. I see the bride, also a cousin, age 24, dressed in a bridal gown. One of my aunts (can't remember who) came up to us and asks us why we aren't ready. We assure her that we will hasten home and get ready. On the way home we pass a fruit store. My mother and dad are just coming out the door. I angrily yell at my mother for not having reminded me to get ready. We approach the house which appears to be an apt. bldg with an unusual number of steps leading up to the door. As we are ready to ascend the steps we are accosted by 2 boys. I ignore the one who attempts to speak to me, noticing that he has little hair on the top of his head. I say to myself that he has no more hair than my boyfriend. We go up to the apartment. The next scene is in a church. I am standing in front of a mirror. I look at my bridesmaid gown and discover it is extremely large in the waist. When I look again it has changed to a house dress. I remember feeling very relieved and reassuring myself that it wasn't the gown but the housedress that was too large. I ask someone (don't remember who) if there is a washroom somewhere. I enter a doorway and see a number of men milling around. I remember saying: Heads up. Interpretation The apartment is entirely unfamiliar to me. My cousin age 17, is to be a bridesmaid at my other cousin's age 24 wedding. This is the second dream I've had about her wedding. I explain it as due to my excitement at being a bridesmaid for the first time. My gown was being altered and I greatly feared that it wouldn't fit upon its completion. This probably accounts for the fact that it was too large in my dream. The housedress episode seems to symbolize my refusal to believe that the dress would be too large.

There are many little cubby holes which I presume to contain toilets. However I did not see any. Each cubby hole was covered in front with a white curtain.

1095,hall_female,"College women, late 1940s",445,"Code 064, Age 21, 11/10/47","I am walking down a street which I recognize as being near PHJH. A man, a woman, and a baby in a carriage approach me. I can see the man and woman's features very clearly. They are both unfamiliar to me. The man lifts the buggy in the air. He seems to be trying to get it over a puddle. I stretch out my arms and help him. I look into the buggy and wrinkle up my nose at the baby. The next scene takes place in an apartment. The same 3 people are present. The young mother attempts to give the baby a bottle. The milk is too hot. She tries to give him the bottle again; it is still too hot. She finally gives it to the baby and he refuses it because it is too cold. The man throughout this procedure appears to be hostile toward his wife. In the next scene I pass a mother (same woman) and a little boy on the corner of a busy intersection (unfamiliar). The boy is now about 4-5 years old. I can see his features very clearly, yet he, too, is unfamiliar to me. I again wrinkle up my nose at him and remember that I had done the same thing when he was an infant. I turn the corner and walk down a street. I past a store and look into the store window. I see my image. I notice that I appear just as young, but am slightly heaver in weight. Interpretation I have been contemplating marriage with a student of the University and have spent quite a bit of thought on the fact that I would not be able to have children for perhaps 4-5 yrs. I believe this child symbolizes the child I would not be able to have. That is why I believe, when he appears to be 4-5 yrs. old, I still look the same. I would analyze the man's hostility toward his wife thus: It has often said that a wife neglects her husband upon the birth of a child and I am determined to divide my love upon the birth of my child in order that my husband should not be deprived of any previous relationship. The only location which I can explain is that of proximity to P.H.J.H. We parked nearby one evening. Answers to questions 2. Can remember no emotion.3. Onlooker4. Neither5.

I remember that it is quite dark in the basement and I was alone. I approached a stairway leading from the basement outside and see the outline of a tall, heavily built man, his back to me, bolting the door. I cannot remember seeing his face. Be turned around and I screamed for help. There was a leather couch down in the basement, exactly like the one found in the MA lounge. I can't remember details, but I got the impression that he attacked me. The next thing I remember is being outside, crying, and seeing my boyfriend. I rush toward him and bury my head in his shoulder. A policeman appears on the scene and at the same time my attacker. My boyfriend points the man out to the policeman, who takes him away. Interpretation Two possibilities occur to me in interpretation of this dream. Perhaps the dream actually represents a fear of being attacked. We live in a practically totally negro-populated neighborhood. I have felt a bit scared upon walking down the street at night, but somehow I don't think it would manant a dream of this type. Stretching the imagination a bit, I can see that it might indirectly point to a desire for sexual intercourse.

1097,hall_female,"College women, late 1940s",447,"Code 064, Age 21, 11/22/47","I am sitting at a long table similar to those found in T living. The room appears to be one found in SBL. I am working on my English Source theme. There are a few people at the table, but I'm not sure of their identity or sex. One of them has some cards which contain information for a source theme. I look them over, thinking that perhaps I can use the information, when someone tells me that it concerns E. (My theme deals with the A C) I see a woman and her little girl approaching. I remember thinking there was something very odd about the little girl. Her face was very different looking as were her clothes. I saw her features and those of her mother very clearly, yet they were totally unfamiliar to me. Her mother addresses her as The Princess. The little girl goes to put out a book, but a man enters the scene. I think he prevented her from taking the book. I remember that the little girl kept smiling. She appeared to be about seven or eight years old. The dream gets confused here. There seems to be a conspiracy to see that no one leaves the library alive. But, without speaking, there seems to be an agreement between the librarian and me to see that I leave unharmed. Interpretation I can well understand my dreaming about the source theme. It is due Wednesday and I haven't started it as yet. (writing it, that is.) The cards probably represent the fact that I feel I don't have enough information to write a source theme with. I put off the writing for today and have had no little anxiety concerning it. The episode of the woman and little girl doesn't bring anything to mind. Although the fact that she referred to her as the princess probably refers to the much publicised Princess Elizabeth's wedding. The episode of impending death would seem to indicate a fear of death on my part, but an uneacelingness to believe that it could actually happen to me. I confess to having given the matter a great deal of thought at various times in my life, but none recently. I know that I do not fear death, my only fear is that I may die young, before having experienced a happy married life and the joy of having children. Answers to questions 2.

1098,hall_female,"College women, late 1940s",448,"Code 064, Age 21, 12/08/47","This dream I am not a participant at any time. The dream first takes place in a train terminal. I see a boy and girl embracing. Some voice says that they both have one interest in common: oil. I then see two pipes which seem to be going up and down. The next thing I remember is their being married and settled in an apartment. There seems to be a story teller in my dream. He says that this marriage is a triangle including the man, his wife, and his mother-in-law. The mother-in-law continually called her daughter to remind her of appointments, etc. In the next scene the girl is making supper. She opens the icebox and I saw a gallon jar in the icebox. It contained huge pink and red roses in a fluid. On the bottom of the jar there is a label which gives a company name and says they preserve wedding flowers. The girl then looks into the stove. I see what appear to be different types of leftovers (meat pie, etc.) being reheated. The girl wonders if there will be enough and says she will just eat a little. Interpretation I do not understand the ""oil"" element of this dream. This dream seems to be another of a series of dreams concerning marriage, which I am contemplating. I can well understand the occurrence of mother-in-law in the dream as I am a bit frightened at the prospect of acquiring one. I did not get off to such a good start with my boyfriend's mother and am afraid I may run into a little difficulty with her. The preserved flowers represent my proposed marriage, I suppose.

1099,hall_female,"College women, late 1940s",449,"Code 064, Age 21, 12/08/47","I am in a department store (resembling H--). I seem to be on a floor other than the first. Preparations are being made for a style show, in which I am to participate. I seem to be wearing a wool dress of checked material. I get on an elevator going down, but when we get to the basement I notice the belt of my dress is missing. We return to the same floor and then find that the belt is in the elevator. I put it on, and at first it doesn't seem to match the dress, but then later it does. We return to the basement. The style show is already in progress. The audience seated in rows or benches, seems to be composed of all young people. A girl whom I know is master of ceremonies. She brings out a dog and a duck and says they allow no petting there. Then I wondered if perhaps I hadn't heard wrong, maybe she said ""We allow no pets here."" One of the models has already gone on the stage. I wonder where the other models are and where we are to go. Another girl is with me, I don't know who she is. We go into a little building. One wall is off allowing us to see into it. I see girls lying in bed in P. J.'s studying. I then see a girl (who is in my S-- class). She is fully clothed. I ask her if she knows where the models are. She goes to the window and points to a small building. I ask her how I can get there. I think perhaps I can climb out the window, but when I look down I notice that it's quite a jump. I ask her if there is a back door and she says ""yes"" We go out the back door and see a group of girls standing in a row. I am particularly impressed with the variety of bright colors which they are wearing. I recognize one of the girls as my former roommate. She is dressed in bright yellow. She waves to me and shouts that she is getting her grades the next day. Interpretation The theme of my dream would seem to indicate a desire for clothes. My wardrobe has been quite depleted and I have been contemplating replenishing it. I have been pretty anxious about my lack of clothes as I do not feel as self-confident when I am not well dressed. My boyfriend, also, has been insisting that I buy myself something to wear. The appearance of the duck and dog, I guess was a convenient way to introduce the theme of petting into my dream. I am contemplating getting engaged and we have discussed the possibility of petting as a preparation for the intimacies of marriage. However, both of us decided we would have severe feelings of guilt if we did pet.

I tell him ""no"" and cross the street. He follows me. Then somehow he gets ahead of me. I throw a glass at him, but miss. I see a group of people gather around a woman who is stretched on the ground. A young woman is crying: She says her mother's hand has been cut off.

I was awakened abruptly by my father at this part--it was 7:10 in the morning. Interpretation I cannot determine what the man stands for in my dream.

1101,hall_female,"College women, late 1940s",451,"Code 064, Age 21, 12/29/47","I seemed to be in a drawing class sitting around a long table. The class was instructed to draw a duck. Another girl was sitting at my table but I can't remember who she was. We were asked to come to the front of the room to hear a story. All of the girls sit down on small chairs. I sit down and then change my seat. Our teacher is a young woman (in her twenties, unfamiliar to me). Everyone had a white sheet in front of them with a pencil. I had no pencil, but tell myself that I will be able to remember. One of the girls reads a story about ducks. All of the girls laugh. We then go back to our seats. It's getting dark. Another class comes up from the basement ready to go home. This class consists of all small children, mostly dressed in snowsuits. I get angry because we have not been told to go home. Then teacher says we can go home and wishes us a happy Easter. Someone turns the lights off and I cannot find my crayons. I look in my box (resembling my evening bag) and see only two crayons. I look on the table and see a bunch of little stubs of crayons and some large ones, but can't determine their color in the dark. Someone (a man) tries to find the light but cannot. I become very angry. A girl (about 21, in my E-- class) comes up to me and shows me her hand, palm up. I see a ring. I turn my hand up and she says ""Oh, you've got one, too!"" I ask her if she just got hers. She says ""no."" Her ring is smaller than mine and she says she couldn't wear my size. I tell her that my hand is proportionately larger. Interpretation This dream seems to tie in with the Christmas dinner we had at my fiance's home. The duck would seem to represent the goose we ate. After dinner my fiance and I had a discussion about how differently our respective homes were run- the fact that his mother was much more economical in buying and using her food and in furnishing her home. I guess the discussion raised a doubt in my mind as to whether or not he and I would see eye to eye on the expenditure of money. The episode of the ring is pretty obvious to me. I became engaged ~ few weeks ago and as is pretty common with girls, I wondered what others would think of my ring. I was also a little doubtful as to whether I liked it or not. The drawing and crayons I find difficult to fit in as I have no interest in them and can't imagine what they could symbolize. Easter probably represents Christmas. The only thing I am reminded of with regard to the lights is that before my fiance and I had our discussion, we had to turn on the light in the kitchen. Answers to questions 2.

I recognized two of the people as being my cousin (a girl, age 30) and her husband. There were many people present. I was holding a baby which seemed to be my cousin's. He talked quite fluently for his age and I was much impressed by his intelligence. The scene shifts to my aunt's home (age 40). She seems to be showing me around her house. We come to one room that is empty and looks as if it had not been used in years. She then shows me a bedroom and I particularly notice the gay bedspread and matching drapes. We come to another room and I notice that it contains a double bed and two twin beds. I seem to owe her some money and she brings out a white slip with pencilled items on it and starts to figure. Interpretation The party probably represents the engagement party my mother plans to give in my honor quite soon. My cousin probably enters the dream as we were discussing the fact that she recently had a miscarriage. The scene in my aunt's home probably occurred because of the lengthy conversations I have had with my fiance, my parents and friends about the difficulty of finding an apartment and my wondering about how I would furnish it. The empty room can probably be explained by the fact that if we get a house or a large apartment we will probably close off one room as we cannot afford to furnish an entire house. The issue of twin and double beds arose in our discussion (my fiancees and mine) and we found that a double bed had the greater asset balance.

Quite shocked, honestly. He had never been there before. I didn't know that he was coming up here to visit. I didn't know that he even knew where the school was so I was very surprised to find him there. We were sitting at the school watching traffic go by. We could see a playground from where we were sitting. As we were sitting there, I realized that we were moving. We were both sitting but somehow we were moving. We finally got up and walked back to where we were and walked back then to my car. We were talking about he was there. He expressed a lot of frustration with Daddy. He made some comments about the possibility of moving out. With some hesitation, I suggested to him that Brian F leave Chantelle F and that he and Brian F move to Indy, buy a house, and live together. Then I suggested, hesitantly, that maybe he should spend two weeks with me as kind of a trial period. It would help me out. He could pay me some rent. He could be there for Matthew when I'm not. It would be a good situation for me too. We should do it on a trial basis. While we're talking, we're driving back to the apartment. When we get to the apartment, I go in and realize that I had been robbed. It's somewhat odd, the things that they took. The living room was completely cleaned out. There was nothing left in there. I went in the kitchen and the refrigerator was gone. I remember thinking that I would have to replace the refrigerator as well as all my food. The dryer was gone but not the washer. My apartment had a window air conditioner and they had taken that out of the window and set it on the floor. I went into my bedroom and the only thing that was gone out of my bedroom was my bed. When I came back into the living room, Bill F and Matthew were standing there waiting for me. Bill F commented that something just didn't feel right. At that point, I realized that I didn't check the bathroom. I went to check the bathroom and the door was closed. I opened it without thinking first. There was somebody in my shower. I quickly closed the door and we ran out of the apartment and ran next door to a neighbor called Pop. Pat C and some friends were in her apartment doing laundry and I asked if I could use her phone to call the police. She, of course, let me. I called the police. I don't remember the conversation. After I hung up I went back into the apartment because I thought he would be gone by now. Just as I opened the apartment door, Bill F and Matthew were behind me; this huge man was standing there. I yanked the apartment door closed and as I held it closed, I waved Bill F and Matthew back into the neighbor's apartment. I let go, ran into the neighbor's apartment, and locked the door. This burglar came out of my apartment. He was slamming against the neighbor's door trying to get it open. He finally did get it open. He said he was just looking for a place to take a shower. He didn't say anything about all the things that were gone or missing. He asked if I would rather if he came in there and finished his shower. I said no, no. I pushed him out. I watched and he had trouble getting out of the actual building. He went ahead and left. I started to think that insurance would take care of everything, but then I realized I had no property insurance. How could I get my property insurance reinstated if I file a report, or how could I get my insurance back and then make the claim and still have everything covered by insurance. I started thinking about the morality of that and thought that wasn't right for me to do that. I'll just have to suffer the lost. I also started wondering if friends or family would take up money to help me. How would I replace my lost things? I could get the new bedroom suite that I had been wanting for a long time. Just different odd things like that. The other thing that I remember about the dream that I find very odd, both that it was in the dream and that I remember it was that when I was in the neighbor's apartment there was a cat in there, standing on it's hind legs, urinating into a bowl. I remember the neighbor moving the bowl a little so the cat didn't urinate on the carpet.",visit matthew school walk around premise run bill surprise quite shock honestly never know come visit know even knew school surprise find sitting school watch traffic go could see playground sit sit realize move sit somehow move finally get walk back walk back car talk express lot frustration daddy make comment possibility move hesitation suggest brian leave chantelle brian move indy buy house live together suggest hesitantly maybe spend two week kind trial period would help could pay rent could matthew would good situation trial basis talk drive back apartment get apartment go realize robbed somewhat odd thing take live room completely clean nothing leave go kitchen refrigerator go remember think would replace refrigerator well food dryer go washer apartment window air conditioner take window set floor go bedroom thing go bedroom bed come back living room bill matthew stand wait bill comment something feel right point realize check bathroom go check bathroom door close open without think first somebody shower quickly close door run apartment run next door neighbor call pop pat friends apartment laundry ask could use phone call police course let call police remember conversation hung go back apartment thought would go opened apartment door bill matthew behind huge man stand yank apartment door close hold close waved bill matthew back neighbor apartment let go ran neighbor apartment lock door burglar come apartment slam neighbor door try get open finally get open say look place take shower say anything thing go miss ask would rather come finish shower say push watch trouble get actual building go ahead leave start think insurance would take care everything realize property insurance could get property insurance reinstate file report could get insurance back make claim still everything cover insurance start think morality think right suffer lose also start wonder friend family would take money help would replace lose thing could get new bedroom suite want long time different odd thing like thing remember dream find odd dream remember neighbor apartment cat stand hind leg urinate bowl remember neighbor move bowl little cat urinate carpet,13.872608,13.695105,845,2,11,2,4,7,4,7,11,9,17,2

He turned around and came back in. I had taken off my nightgown and was now holding it up against me to keep myself covered. He made some comment about my not having anything on. I told him I thought he was leaving, that was why I did it. He went on to make some comment about what people on campus would say or do if we were personally involved. He said something about getting fired and then something else I don't remember about it being risky. I said, maybe I don't mind the risk! He just looked at me kind of odd and half-smiled then left. The next thing I knew we were in a bedroom, still talking about my classes. I was lying in bed covered with a blanket but had no clothes on. Doctor Pi was sitting on the bed beside me with his back to me, though he was leaning against me, and he had one hand on me I must have said something to him about being worried because he said, yeah, I'm scared too. Then he smiled reassuringly. Students kept coming in to ask him questions.

1408,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,21,1997-05-13,"I was with Bill F at SMW. We were trying to see where Doctor Pi lives. We went in this large building. It looked like a combined office and storage space. Everything was a mess. There were many different rooms. Each room had many different things in it. no boxes. but things sitting out piled on tables and such. I finally looked into one room and I saw Doctor Pi. He was sitting with his back to me, watching TV and combing his hair. Bill F and I walked away and looked into this big double-door closet. I don't remember what was in there. Suddenly Doctor Pi saw us. He seemed a bit embarrassed at his living arrangements. He said that most of his money goes to child support so he couldn't afford much in terms of a place to live. The next thing I remember is he saying that he loves me and wants to marry me. I replied that I love him to and that I accept. We talked a bit about Matthew and about Belle.",bill smw try see doctor pi life go large build look like combined office storage space everything mess many different room room many different thing box thing sit pile table finally look one room saw doctor pi sit back watch tv comb hair bill walk away look big double door closet remember suddenly doctor pi saw u seem bit embarrassed living arrangement say money go child support afford much term place live next thing remember say love want marry reply love accept talk bit matthew belle,13.710992,13.792913,181,1,4,2,1,5,0,4,4,1,8,2
1409,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,22,1997-06-15,"I came to the store and Nicki T was working. She said nothing to me but was working on wearing a cordless phone, which was made to fit into a carry bag of sorts that was to be worn over the shoulder. The base with the numbers was carried in the back part and the speaker/receiver in the front. She was working closely with a sales associate named Nicki T. I reminded her that the phone is only for the store manager and store business. She just shrugged her shoulders. I took her into the back room of the store to talk with her about the apology and other related things. This wasn't our real backroom. It looked like the backroom of the drug stores where I used to work. We were sitting across from each other at a 6ft. table. As we were talking someone just appeared sitting in a chair next to me. I did not recognize her. She told me she was an angel. She was a large woman with very long, permed, light brown hair, which she wore parted in the middle and hanging straight down. I asked Nicki T if she saw her and Nicki T said yes. I asked why she was here and she said to help me. One of the first issues I began talking to Nicki T about was doing markdowns the correct way. I told her she had to do the items in the backroom as well. She wanted to know why and explained to her that was the only way for those things to be correctly priced when they went to the sales floor. As I was explaining this, I saw the section of the backroom where all baby products were stored. I remember seeing baby powder and Vaseline in particular but there was a long row of such products. We then went on to the way she is managing the sales associate Nicki T and the example she sets. She had been trying to keep Nicki T away from me. I reminded her that she is not the store manager, she cannot keep employees from me, and she must set a good example for the staff. She gave me the look she always does when she gets an attitude and said something but I don't know what. I asked the angel how I was doing and she said fine, patted me on the arm, and smiled reassuringly. Four new people appeared. A man, women, a girl, and a boy. I did not know them and asked them who they were. They, too, said they were angels there to offer me their support. They patted me on the shoulder and then said hello to the other angel touching her on the shoulder. They remained standing directly behind me and the other angel. I asked Nicki T if she saw them and she said yes. Someone else walked by and I asked them the same thing and they said yes. I wanted to reassure myself that I wasn't just seeing them because I wanted to. I ended my conversation with Nicki T by saying I wasn't going to put up with anymore. I told her that even though it might make my life much more difficult at least temporarily that the next time she screwed around with policy I would terminate her. She acted as though she didn't believe me and I told her she better, because I would. She left the room. I turned to the first angel, the others were now gone though I don't remember them leaving. I asked the angel how she thought I did and she said I did the right thing and I had done fine. I asked her how God thought I did. She said I didn't need him to tell me that. I said but I want to know that he thinks I did the right thing. She said she would ask him, she closed her eyes, within seconds she had a smile on her face. Then she chuckled a little. When she opened her eyes, she said he wants me to ask when I need help but other than that, I don't need his constant reassurance on matters like this. After this was over, I called my friend Jennifer K to tell her about my angel experience. I was so excited that I had an angel encounter. We talked about it a bit but I don't remember any of it. The next thing I knew I was in a large office, supposedly of the company where I work but the surroundings were not familiar to me. A lawyer approached me and said he was representing the sales associate Nicki T. I told him he would have to wait for a few minutes before I spoke to him. I knew I needed to try to get in touch with a company representative before talking to an attorney. I remember asking some of the office workers why Nicki T would need or want an attorney and what were going on because I didn't feel that I knew what was going on. None of them knew what had happened that she would have an attorney either. We were trying unsuccessfully to find a corporate person to give me approval to talk with the attorney or to provide our own attorney. Nicki T's attorney asked me why I felt I needed an attorney present to talk with him. I replied that it was not wise for me to speak with an attorney regarding company business without consulting our own company attorney first. As I was looking for our company attorney or human resource person or someone I said perhaps I should go to the sister company office next door and see if someone there could help. The office staff at my office did not know whom I would talk to there so they were trying to find out. While I was waiting, I went into one of the back offices. There were quite a few other people in this room. I was told that everyone in there was being punished by being put on a game show. One of the people in the room was actor/director Ron Howard. He had put on several different costumes and was required to do comedy routines in each one. He was with two other people in each of these routines. The final routine each of the two people he was with was required to light a huge firecracker of sorts. One person lit his on the top and it sparked a bit and then fizzled. The other lit his from the bottom and it shot off into the air. Someone said that is what you were supposed to do with them, so the first guy lit his at the bottom and it took off into the air. Both firecrackers were flying around the office in and out of hallways and doors. I crouched to the floor to avoid being hit. Someone said that was the whole purpose of lighting them, to avoid being hit by them.",come store nicki work say nothing work wear cordless phone make fit carry bag sort wear shoulder base number carry back part speaker receiver front work closely sale associate name nicki remind phone store manager store business shrug shoulder take back room store talk apology relate thing real backroom look like backroom drug store use work sit across table talk someone appear sit chair next recognize tell angel large woman long perm light brown hair wear part middle hang straight ask nicki saw nicki say yes ask say help one first issue begin talk nicki markdowns correct way told item backroom well want know explain way thing correctly price go sale floor explain saw section backroom baby product store remember see baby powder vaseline particular long row product go way manage sale associate nicki example set try keep nicki away remind store manager keep employee must set good example staff give look always get attitude say something know ask angel say fine pat arm smile reassuringly four new people appear man woman girl boy know ask say angel offer support pat shoulder say hello angel touch shoulder remain stand directly behind angel ask nicki saw say yes someone else walk ask thing say yes wanted reassure see want end conversation nicki say go put anymore tell even though might make life much difficult least temporarily next time screw around policy would terminate act though believe tell well would leave room turn first angel others go though remember leave ask angel think say right thing fine ask god think say need tell say want know think right thing say would ask closed eye within second smile face chuckle little opened eye say want ask need help need constant reassurance matter like call friend jennifer tell angel experience excite angel encounter talk bite remember next thing know large office supposedly company work surroundings familiar lawyer approach say represent sale associate nicki tell would wait minute speak know need try get touch company representative talk attorney remember ask office worker nicki would need want attorney go feel knew go none know happen would attorney either try unsuccessfully find corporate person give approval talk attorney provide attorney nicki attorney ask felt need attorney present talk reply wise speak attorney regard company business without consult company attorney first look company attorney human resource person someone say perhaps go sister company office next door see someone could help office staff office know would talk try find wait go one back office quite people room tell everyone punish put game show one people room actor director ron howard put several different costume require comedy routine one two people routines final routine two people require light huge firecracker sort one person light top spark bit fizzled lit bottom shot air someone say suppose first guy lit bottom take air firecracker fly around office hallway door crouch floor avoid hit someone say whole purpose light avoid hit,13.698649,13.585139,1200,8,13,4,9,8,6,6,23,13,30,2
1410,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,23,1999-01-17,"My mother and my son had both said some things about John Davidson, unpleasant and untrue, and they had started to spread as rumors. One of them, the one my son said, had actually been printed as a headline in a newspaper. John was in our town one day and so we told them they had to talk with him and tell him what they said, that they were responsible for it and to apologize to him. My mother did it. My son also did it. He said he wanted me to be with him when he did. Shortly after, I saw him sitting down at a table with John so I went over to join them. When I got there all of the seats were taken by many of Matthew's friends and John. I asked Matthew if he still wanted me there. He said, well, since I didn't ask you to be here in the first place. He started laughing and looking at his friends. I slapped his check, not too hard but hard enough to sting. I told him that's what he gets for lying and I walked away. I was walking through the town looking at the houses as I walked. I came upon several houses that had black wrought iron shelves on the back outside walls. They were on rollers, kind of like the roller ladders you see by high library shelves. I was commenting on how much I liked those. I was thinking about buying one of those houses. I heard that John was interested in this particular house. I remember thinking that perhaps John and I would get together then. Somebody standing near me asked me if I had seen the fifth floor of the house. I remember looking up at it for the first time and counting the floors. I only saw four so I thought it must have a basement. They took me inside to show me the fifth floor. When I went inside to see the fifth floor, I was suddenly a teenage girl accompanied by my mother and a girl friend. As we went through the house I noticed how old it was, and that it needed a lot of remodeling but I thought how fun that would be. I also noticed the floors were all hardwood and in very bad shape. I thought about the stripping and refinishing that would be needed. When we came to the fifth floor, there were two rooms. The first room was a nicely decorated dining room. It seemed as though there might be a kitchen off the dining room, but I did not see it. The table was set for a meal and in fact there were two people sitting getting ready to eat and they had food on their plates. A third person emerged through a door with more food, perhaps a turkey. It seemed as though they were preparing to celebrate a holiday meal and that they were expecting us for dinner. They asked us to join them. The person who emerged with the food was a blonde, pretty woman perhaps in her early 40's. The next thing I know, we are still in the house. I see the housekeeper, a black, heavyset woman, looking very sad as though she will not be needed here any longer. The next thing I see she is putting two children to bed. She is lying in bed with them to tell them a bedtime story. The one child is very small, perhaps one year old or less. The other appears to perhaps be near the age of three. At this moment, I get the sense that I am the older child, though I am watching this happen and I am still in the same house. We then go to see the other room of the fifth floor of this house. There is nothing in the room except a ladder that leads to a very dark area, maybe another room or attic? My girlfriend and I are alone so we decide to climb the ladder and see what is up there. I don't know how we manage but we seem to both be near the top of the ladder looking into this area. It is indeed an attic. It has a lot of stuff in there that we think looks so cool! There is something almost right in front of us that is covered by a cloth. We remove the cloth and are startled to find it is a very small gorilla, about the size of a monkey. The gorilla only moves slightly, looks directly at us, but makes no sound. We cover it again quickly. We debate whether we should go into the attic and look around. We think we shouldn't but we go anyway. We are too curious and really want to look at some of this cool stuff up here. We are now walking through several rooms of the house talking about what it would cost to redecorate and how we can come up with a budget. I am wondering how I would go about this. I want to have a decorator come in. I am still with my girlfriend. We are making a list of what we would need to do in each room. Wallpaper, curtains, wall plate covers, paint, throw pillows, and bedspreads. We go into another room and do the same thing. One room had a bed in it that had a bedspread on it. There may have actually been two beds. I also saw some baskets and throw pillows that I liked but I thought they were the wrong color. They are what prompted me to add throw pillows to the list for redecorating. The baskets were somewhat attached to the throw pillows and I saw some type of rings or large hoops, also attached. We are back in the attic now, looking at things from two perspectives. One was just the curiosity of seeing what was there and the other perspective was to see if there were things that we could use in the house when we redecorate. I found this straw purse. I'm not sure it was a purse. I commented that it would be really neat to have on a dresser and have scarves flowing out of it. My girlfriend told me to go for it. I can't remember much else of what we found. There were many cats around. I remember thinking of my allergy to cats but it did not bother me enough to make me leave. The last thing we found was a book about three people. I think they were trapeze artists or perhaps circus performers. They were two men and a woman. The woman was in the middle of the picture. We wondered if the woman in the picture was the owner of the house. Just at that time, my mother was at the bottom of the ladder telling us we shouldn't be up there and especially not going through those things. As she was reprimanding us, the owner of the house appeared. She didn't seem particularly upset that we were up there. She seemed somewhat sad, and that she wanted to explain some things to us. I get the feeling that she was going to tell us that she was in fact that woman, that the gorilla was a gift/reminder of that time, and that she just couldn't bear to part with it because of that. I also get some sense that the gorilla was in this attic and covered up because if anyone found out she had it, it would be taken away by the zoo or some such authority. I also some sense of something about her feeding it everyday.",mother son say thing john davidson unpleasant untrue start spread rumor one one son say actually print headline newspaper john town one day tell talk tell say responsible apologize mother son also say want shortly saw sit table john go join get seat take many matthew friend john ask matthew still want say well since ask first place start laugh look friend slap check hard hard enough sting tell get lie walk away walk town look house walk come upon several house black wrought iron shelf back outside wall roller kind like roller ladder see high library shelf comment much like think buy one house hear john interested particular house remember think perhaps john would get together somebody stand near ask see fifth floor house remember look first time count floor saw four thought must basement take inside show fifth floor go inside see fifth floor suddenly teenage girl accompany mother girl friend go house notice old need lot remodel think fun would also noticed floor hardwood bad shape think strip refinish would need come fifth floor two room first room nicely decorate din room seem though might kitchen din room see table set meal fact two people sit get ready eat food plate third person emerge door food perhaps turkey seem though prepare celebrate holiday meal expect u dinner ask u join person emerge food blonde pretty woman perhaps early next thing know still house see housekeeper black heavyset woman look sad though need long next thing see put two child bed lie bed tell bedtime story one child small perhaps one year old less appear perhaps near age three moment get sense old child though watch happen still house go see room fifth floor house nothing room except ladder lead dark area maybe another room attic girlfriend alone decide climb ladder see know manage seem near top ladder look area indeed attic lot stuff think look cool something almost right front u cover cloth remove cloth startle find small gorilla size monkey gorilla move slightly look directly u make sound cover quickly debate whether go attic look around think go anyway curious really want look cool stuff walk several room house talk would cost redecorate come budget wondering would go want decorator come still girlfriend make list would need room wallpaper curtain wall plate cover paint throw pillow bedspread go another room thing one room bed bedspread may actually two bed also saw basket throw pillow like think wrong color prompt add throw pillow list redecorate basket somewhat attach throw pillow saw type ring large hoop also attach back attic look thing two perspective one curiosity see perspective see thing could use house redecorate find straw purse sure purse comment would really neat dresser scarf flow girlfriend tell go remember much else find many cat around remember think allergy cat bother enough make leave last thing find book three people think trapeze artist perhaps circus performer two men woman woman middle picture wonder woman picture owner house time mother bottom ladder tell u especially go thing reprimand u owner house appear seem particularly upset seem somewhat sad want explain thing u get feel go tell u fact woman gorilla gift reminder time bear part also get sense gorilla attic cover anyone find would take away zoo authority also sense something feeding everyday,13.708414,13.527542,1305,7,15,6,5,12,13,5,18,18,31,2
1411,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,24,1999-06-12,"I was with someone in a store kind of like a Kmart. I don't know who I was with but they were shopping in a different part of the store. I was looking for plastic storage containers. I wanted to see how much they were or if they were on sale. When I got to the aisle where the storage containers were they were many sale signs hanging by them on the back wall of the shelving unit. I remember seeing one that made me think they were on sale for $5 and some cents. The signs were hanging next to the containers rather than in front of or over or under the containers, as would normally be the case in a store. There were actually no products for sale under or over the signs. I remember thinking this is a great price. The containers were clear, frosted kind of look, with blue lids. They were rather large, like 5 gallon size perhaps but rectangular. I decided to look more closely at the signs and realized that all of the sale signs were for personal care products that weren't even in that aisle. They were hanging in layers on top of each other but maybe four or five across also. I thought to myself, ah, the employee who was supposed to hang these probably didn't want to do it so hung them all here just to say the job was done. I went to find a manager to tell them about it. I found a young man, though I don't know if he was a manager or not, and told him about the signs. I walked back to the location with him. When we got there, an employee had just finished filling that spot with Tampons. I get a sense that he put the tampons there but I'm not sure. The tampons were piled so high that they hid the sale signs completely. The man I brought back to show them to somehow looked behind the tampons and saw the signs. As I walked away, he was using a hammer to loosen the shelf above the tampons/containers/signs. I thought that he was doing that so he could get to the signs to remove them. The next thing I remember is that I was still in the same store but I was looking at clothing. As I was looking, I encountered a woman acquaintance. I say acquaintance because I don't know who she was. I get the sense that she was someone that I was not particularly fond of. I chatted with her a bit; she was just standing around waiting for someone she was with who was shopping. I selected a few items and went to the dressing room to try them on. As I returned from the dressing room, I went by the men's dressing rooms. They were all full. While I could not see any of the men in the room, I got the sense that one man was completely naked and I could see pubic hair, nothing else. I felt embarrassed and tried to hurry by. Some men looked at me as though they thought I worked here. I remember thinking to myself that I have spent too much time working in retail, because my past work in retail affects my shopping experiences, related to things like the sale signs. Now these men think I work here. They were trying on sports coats. I commented to both of them that they looked great. They were both black men. The one seemed very happy that I told him he looked great. He said something to the other man as I walked away. I don't know what he said. I went back to where I got the clothes I had just tried on. The woman acquaintance was still there. She was kind of leaning on a circular rack full of clothing. I approached her again; I think to put the clothes back that I had just tried on. She was standing so close to the rack that she was somewhat in between the clothes on the rack. I started talking with her again. It seems that we were talking about a mutual acquaintance. I don't really remember, except that she made some comment about alcoholism and I asked her if she was an alcoholic. She said yes. I am now walking around the store pushing a shopping cart and at the same time trying to carry a large metal ladder. I can't remember why I had the ladder. It also seems to me that there was nothing in the shopping cart. I have been called to the manager's office. When I walk in there are two male management members and one female. I remember nothing about the female. The one male did all of the talking and the other male, who seemed to be his superior kept fidgeting in his chair and turning his back to me through the whole conversation. The male who did all of the talking was the actor who used to play Judge Harry Stone on night court. He began by saying they wanted to discuss a few things with me. They handed me a list and began to go over the list. The list was typed on rather dark, brown, very heavy stock paper. I wondered to myself why they had chosen this because you could hardly read what was typed on it. The first things they discussed were very general and did not appear odd to me. I was cordial and making light, comments to evoke smiles or chuckles as the conversation began. They said they had been watching me on camera that afternoon. I think that it was at this point that I determined that they were terminating my employment. I looked at Harry and said, you are accusing me of stealing aren't you. He said, you bet we are! I realized we all had the brown pages and they were in a binder with a rather large number of other pages though the others were all white. I told him I wanted him to put that in writing, on one of the white pages. He said gladly. He and I started flipping through the white pages. It was as though he wanted to pick a certain page to write it on. I didn't care; I just wanted it in writing. I was so very angry. I had stood up at this point and was talking very loudly and angrily at him while pointing to the book and asking him to put that in writing.",someone store kind like kmart know shop different part store look plastic storage container want see much sale get aisle storage container many sale sign hang back wall shelving unit remember see one make think sale cent sign hang next container rather front container would normally case store actually product sale sign remember think great price container clear frost kind look blue lid rather large like gallon size perhaps rectangular decide look closely sign realize sale sign personal care product even aisle hang layer top maybe four five across also think ah employee suppose hang probably want hung say job go find manager tell find young man though know manager tell sign walk back location get employee finish fill spot tampon get sense put tampon sure tampon pile high hid sale sign completely man bring back show somehow look behind tampon saw sign walk away use hammer loosen shelf tampon container sign think could get sign remove next thing remember still store look clothing look encounter woman acquaintance say acquaintance know get sense someone particularly fond chatted bit stand around wait someone shopping select item go dress room try return dress room go men dress room full could see men room get sense one man completely naked could see pubic hair nothing else felt embarrassed tried hurry men look though thought work remember think spend much time work retail past work retail affect shop experience related thing like sale sign men think work try sport coat comment look great black men one seem happy tell look great say something man walk away know say go back got clothes try woman acquaintance still kind lean circular rack full clothing approach think put clothes back try stand close rack somewhat clothe rack start talk seem talk mutual acquaintance really remember except make comment alcoholism ask alcoholic say yes walk around store push shop cart time try carry large metal ladder remember ladder also seem nothing shop cart call manager office walk two male management member one female remember nothing female one male talk male seem superior keep fidget chair turn back whole conversation male talk actor use play judge harry stone night court begin say want discuss thing hand list begin go list list type rather dark brown heavy stock paper wonder chosen could hardly read type first thing discus general appear odd cordial make light comment evoke smile chuckle conversation begin say watch camera afternoon think point determine terminate employment look harry say accuse steal say bet realize brown page binder rather large number page though others white tell want put write one white page say gladly start flip white page though wanted pick certain page write care want write angry stand point talk loudly angrily point book ask put write,13.710373,13.589068,1118,8,10,4,7,6,9,2,12,12,22,2
1412,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,25,1999-08-23,"I was Robin Williams. All three of the children from the movie were there and they were my children. We were riding in an airplane. I don't know why. We were in something like a cargo compartment where we couldn't see the pilot. The pilot may have been flying us down, but I'm not sure. We were all holding on trying to help. It was as if the plane wasn't going to make it all the way over. So we tilted to one side to help the plane go over. As it started to go over, we ran to the other side to help it balance. I don't know what happened. The older daughter and I were outside the airplane. There like bars on the outside that we were hanging onto. I remember having a real close look at the feet of the older daughter. She spent her time putting her feet in a place where she would be able to keep holding on. I realize I am somewhere else, and all three of the children have died in that flight. Somehow, I survived. It was just killing me. I was just dying inside. There was this conveyor belt. All of the children's clothes are coming down a conveyor belt all clean and pressed. clothes that they had on in their accident. It's just killing me that they all died. I just thought I was going to die. I thought I was going to die from the pain. It hurt so badly. The next thing I know I'm in my house and I'm myself again. A friend of mine from high school, Freda L, showed up. She came in my house. She was holding something like a postcard like the ones sent out for Tupperware parties and such. I guess I was having some kind of party like that or selling something like that. It wasn't Tupperware but I don't know exactly what it was. Freda L had come over to give me her order. There is a bunch of people around but I don't know why and I don't know any of them. I don't know if they were all women or if they were both men and women. We went outside and there were people outside too. Some of them were in water. It seemed to be more like a pond than a swimming pool. At that point, it seems that the people were both men and women. Freda L was in the pond now. I asked her if I told her about Darren. She said, no. I told her that he died last week. She went under water and didn't come back up. She was okay. She was under water because she was crying and didn't want anyone to see her. Then, another high school friend, Dorothea D, was there. She wanted to know what was wrong with Freda L. Someone said to her that Anna told her that Darren died last week. Dorothea D said, do you mean the Darren that used to be on Bewitched? I said no, my Darren. Many people were very sad, and so shocked by the news. All I could think about was how terrible I felt about my children dying. I was in so much pain over losing my children. I was having a conversation with God. He assured me that they spent a few seconds being very, very scared but that he went to them and he talked to them, answered their questions, and gave them comfort. They died on impact so they didn't feel any pain. Because he went to them and answered their questions, they weren't scared anymore. While we were having this conversation, I was starting to wash down the inside walls of this baggage compartment or whatever it was that we were in. I was trying to make it all smooth. It was black. There was all this water in it. I think the plane crashed into the water and they died. I don't know why I didn't or how I got out of it. I had like a rag or sponge and dipping into the water and then without wringing it out I would take it to the top of this wall and wash this wall down where it would be smooth and black with no marks on it. I wasn't successful. I just kept doing it.

1413,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,26,1999-08-23,"Matthew was spending the night with Michael A and Theresa Ah. I don't know why he was spending the night with them. She asked me to watch their baby. They had a baby about 4-5 years ago, shortly before we saw them the last time. I told them I would watch the baby for them. I put her in the front seat of the car with me. I didn't have a child car seat. I just sat her up in the seat. I think she was maybe less than but close to a year old. I buckled her in under the seat belt. Theresa Ah seemed to think that was fine. She didn't say anything about it anyway. Now I am walking somewhere, to my destination, but I don't know where that was. I still have the baby, but I have her in something like a lunch bag. I don't think I am carrying anything else. For some reason I am coming down a back road. As I am coming down this back road there is a car headed right straight at me. It's driving on the wrong side of the road. They don't have their headlights on. Eventually I can get over and it misses me. I see that it is a very beat up police car. I keep going and the same thing happens again. Only this time the lights are on, on the other car. It's another police car, but this time it isn't banged up. The next thing I know I'm still headed for my destination but now I'm walking. As I turn this bend, 5-6 men in black jump out. They are in kind of a six-sided formation; I don't know exactly how to explain it. They are all in black and they all have guns. They take a pose, kind of like something you would see in a movie. It scared me. I turned around and tried to walk as fast as I could the other way. I didn't want to run because I didn't want to scare the baby. I didn't want to hurt the baby. The men quickly overtake me. There are police officers who tell me that there are terrorists, out there that they are trying to capture. They escort me to a main section where I can walk. They tell me that I should be fine as long as I stay in this main area. It's a very public area, kind of like walking along an outdoor mall. As I'm walking I keep coming to these cement ponds. They have small cement strips that you can walk on very carefully to get around the water parts without going out to a main street or anything. I'm walking along these strips, I see some bushes or something like that, and I meet two young girls coming the other way. I very carefully manage to pass them. I keep going and then I meet these girls again. This is odd because I thought they were going the other way before. I manage to catch just a part of their conversation. One of them is trying to decide whether to go to college or whether to work. I see as I go by one of them that there is a very small evergreen tree in a big cement flowerpot. I see falling through that, by these girls, something that looks like a tampon. I keep walking and I come to a place where there are these rooms. There is this couch, some furniture sitting outside one of the rooms. This couch is turned with its back towards me. There is a man sitting in the couch. It is James C. I know Brandy C is inside. I don't know why I know it but I do. There is a chair facing the couch, on the outside also, and Matthew is sitting in there. I don't know why he is with them or how he got there. I said something to James C about gunmen. I said that no, they said we would be safe as long as we stayed on these main streets. Matthew didn't say anything. He was sitting there with one leg over the arm of the chair and reading a magazine. I don't know where I am or who I'm talking to. I'm telling some people about the gunmen. I was reassuring them. They were concerned about the safety of the baby. I opened the lunchbox to the show them and myself that she is okay. I told them what the police said and that they assured us that we should be fine as long as we stayed on these main streets. I continue trying to reassure them that we are safe where we are but they don't want to believe me. They want to take off running because this helicopter is hovering overhead. They are telling us that as long as we stay in the general area where we are we will be fine. These people were panicking. They were running all over the place trying to get out. Now, I'm in this room. It almost seems like an overhead, some kind of a room where you can look out and down out these glass windows. I'm feeling calm and safe because the police told me that if we stayed there we would be safe. However, there are all these other people inside and out, running all over in a panic. There are many people milling around. Everyone is calm down. The baby is fine. I'm not worried about her. All of a sudden, I see something like a baseball record, or being safe, like 5 out of 6 times. For some reason the ration seems like 60 out of 1. The father of this baby comes up to me. It looks like he is discussing with the same person that I am standing with about our safety. I try to reassure him that we are perfectly safe where we are. He doesn't seem to want to go for it. He wants some kind of lessons now on protecting himself. I don't know what kind of lessons. They are trying to reassure us. They have some kind of a metal that's digging into me because of being six and one. I tell him he could use the same thing, but he is too panicked and wants to run. All the while, I know that the baby is safe. We were in front of my apartment here. I don't know if I have the baby with me or not. I'm putting something in the back seat of the car. I'm still assuring whoever is with me that we are going to be safe. I notice a water bottle in the back seat of the car. I think I want to get it out. I don't want them to have that.",matthew spending night michael theresa ah know spend night ask watch baby baby year ago shortly saw last time tell would watch baby put front seat car child car seat sit seat think maybe less close year old buckle seat belt theresa ah seem think fine say anything anyway walk somewhere destination know still baby something like lunch bag think carry anything else reason come back road come back road car head right straight drive wrong side road headlight eventually get miss see beat police car keep go thing happens time light car another police car time bang next thing know still head destination walk turn bend men black jump kind six side formation know exactly explain black gun take pose kind like something would see movie scar turn around try walk fast could way want run want scare baby want hurt baby men quickly overtake police officer tell terrorist try capture escort main section walk tell fine long stay main area public area kind like walk along outdoor mall walk keep come cement pond small cement strip walk carefully get around water part without go main street anything walk along strip see bush something like meet two young girl come way carefully manage pa keep go meet girl odd think go way manage catch part conversation one try decide whether go college whether work see go one small evergreen tree big cement flowerpot see fall girl something look like tampon keep walk come place room couch furniture sit outside one room couch turn back towards man sit couch james know brandy inside know know chair face couch outside also matthew sit know got say something james gunman say say would safe long stayed main street matthew say anything sit one leg arm chair read magazine know talk tell people gunman reassure concern safety baby open lunchbox show okay told police say assure u fine long stayed main street continue try reassure safe want believe want take run helicopter hover overhead tell u long stay general area fine people panic run place try get room almost seem like overhead kind room look glass window feel calm safe police tell stay would safe however people inside run panic many people mill around everyone calm baby fine worried sudden see something like baseball record safe like time reason ration seem like father baby come look like discus person stand safety try reassure perfectly safe seem want go want kind lesson protect know kind lesson try reassure u kind metal dig six one tell could use thing panic want run know baby safe front apartment know baby put something back seat car still assure whoever go safe notice water bottle back seat car think want get want,14.011618,13.300508,1188,5,15,2,9,10,8,7,17,13,25,2

I was blocked by a truck that was unloading for The Shoe Store. It had the parking lot and driving area all blocked with a huge thing that was attached to the store and to the truck. I don't know how to explain what it was. Some kind of a conveyor belt for them to unload the shoes from the truck into the store. I was debated how to get where I was going then. All of a sudden, they must have been done, because this huge thing started deflating. It started to collapse. It started to go in, like starting at one end and moving towards the store as it deflated. There was nothing under it as it deflated. It just deflated little by little until it was gone or was done deflating. All that was left was like these robot things that were running towards the store. It seems that maybe the robots had been controlling it or were doing something for the store but I don't know what it was. There is something, not sure they are robots, but something with headphones. There was something about Gale W. She died. It was as if I was there to work. I grabbed some headsets. I was playing around with it.

1415,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,28,1999-09-12,"I was a manager at a type of retail store like a Wal-Mart. I opened up some new packages of different kinds of chewing gums. In one box that I opened, there were six or eight different kinds. After I opened them, I realized that we really didn't need them at the register. I put them there anyway. I remember thinking how good they smelled. I realized that they were different from the ones that were sitting there; the ones that I thought I was going to be refilling or replacing. That's why I decided to just put them there anyway. The cashiers needed some help with some money. I went down. I thought I'd do my part. I'll work my Saturday. I'll work my shift. No extra. As part of the management team, I'll do my part. I'll work my Saturday. The next thing I know I am at GC. I'm sitting in a room in a circle with some other students and people who work there. I was thinking that I've graduated but I'm waiting to hear the assignments of who our student advisor is. Our student advisor is another student who is further along in his or her studies than we are. I'm sitting thinking that I would be one of those advisors, yet I'm sitting there waiting to here who mine is going to be. There are a few that people are really hoping to be assigned to. I'm confused as to whether I am one of those or if I am eager to get one of those people. I go to Terry K and explain to him that I am not going to be there as a student. What I will actually being doing during that time is working on the preparation work or whatever I need to do to present my dissertation idea and asked him if I really need to be there for that. He said he found the campus to be a wonderful, meditative getaway spot for him when he was doing that. He came there simply for that reason because it was such a great place to be to do that type of work. He found it very productive and beneficial. He was able to get a lot done there.

I then handed the microphone to the other adult but don't remember anything that person said. Finally, I told the teens there would be one rule about this room. That rule is confidentiality.

1418,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,31,1999-10-28,"I was with three of the women from the Golden Girls, Blanche, Rose and Dorothy. I was working as a character in a theme park. This was no character that I recognize or have heard of before. I'm not even sure that I can describe it except that I was in water. Maybe I was some kind of sea witch, but not really a witch though. I don't know how to describe it. I don't know what I was doing as that character. People were coming through the park. I was doing different things. I don't think I was scaring them. I can't even remember interacting with them. Most of my interaction was with Blanche, Rose, and Dorothy. They seemed to be doing the same thing I was. They were characters. We came into the park as visitors though. We also visited a kind of church. It is a very different kind of church. We went in the church and there were no benches. There were folding chairs. There was like this platform. It was not really like a stage, more like a loft. There were musicians on the loft. The music was not rock and roll but something that would really appeal to young people today. Everyone in there really seemed to be enjoying the music. They passed a plate around for the collection and there was a comment about this kind of music really helping them to draw more people in and to get better collections. There is a large hallway outside. At that time, I realized that the hallway was filled with young people who were drawn in because of this music. They were getting ready to pass the plate around out there for a collection. They said something about this helping them to build the new church and maybe a school. They wanted to increase their collections so that they could build a new church, or school and a home for their priest. I don't know if it was a home for homeless girls, runaway girls.

1419,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,32,1999-11-05,"I was at the sleep center and had on an orange-colored wool suit. I didn't have the jacket on. I had a blouse on and the skirt. The skirt was huge. The skirt was way, way too big for me. I was running around trying to find a very big safety pin to try to pin it. I was showing everyone how big it was on me and we were getting ready for a research meeting. Now, I was looking in the cabinets and different things and I saw these front office things like labels. They were in two different cabinets instead of all being in the same place. I wondered why they were in two different cabinets instead of all being in the same place. Finally, someone handed me a large paper clip to hold my skirt. I tried it but it didn't work so I kept looking. I finally found a safety pin and I pinned it. About that time, I noticed Doctor W standing, kind of off in the distance, talking to some woman that I didn't know. I get the impression that she works there but I don't know who she is. Julie Ca was there. Anyway, Doctor W called me over and started telling me about a research study that we were going to be involved in and this woman was going to be involved in it. He told me in front of her that I really am not very knowledgeable about research and so she is going to be very involved in this study. We were in a conference room sitting at this table. All of a sudden, there were many people there. They were all strangers. There was no one else I knew. There is one lady that he had just told me was going to be heavily involved in the research study. I was sitting next to Doctor W. I was having a lot of trouble hearing the conversation. The study was going to be a drug study. Doctor W said something about me not saying anything, but he didn't say it to me. He said it to everybody else. Everybody started making fun of me. Saying things like, Oh Anna can't speak, and things like that. This initial woman that he told me was going to be very involved asked me something about the study. I said, Well, I don't know. I've never been involved in a drug study. Then Doctor W made some other comment that I thought was inappropriate. It was kind of a put down. I started to stand up to ask him to step outside the room with me because I was going to ask him not to berate me in front of other people. I half stood up, then changed my mind and said, well, for the purpose of this study, I'm just part of the research team, okay? Then I sat back down. The meeting continued. Again, I was having a very hard time hearing people. I was really straining to turn my head, really straining to hear what was being said. A couple other people came in the room to join the meeting.

The next thing I know, it's as though I've been hung, but not killed yet. I'm suspended from the ceiling. I'm waiting for these people. I think I'm suspended with two or three other women. I can't see them but I have a sense that I was. I'm waiting for the people who want to kill me to come in. When they do, I start swinging, trying to attack them from whatever it was that was suspending me there. The next thing I know I'm no longer suspended. I'm free to roam. I still have this sense that they're trying to kill me. I'm in some lingerie or something but no bottoms on. One of the women that wants to kill me comes in the room and I ask her if she wants to fondle me, thinking that she won't want to kill me then. She says no and leaves. Then I plan how I'm going to get out of there before they come back. I don't remember actually making the plan just that I was going to plan to get out of there before they come back. I was doing some reading for a store report. I make a phone call to ask what I'm supposed to read as a resource to do this paper. I realized as soon as I asked that it was a dumb question because I knew what I was supposed to read. It was a one-page thing that I was supposed to read and then write a paper about it. I felt stupid for having asked. They said, yes, that's what I'm supposed to read to do this paper. Something to do with writing this and then using this writing to present something or teach something. I'm in a line of cars. The car in front of me doesn't have any break lights. We're on a winding hill. It's dark. I almost run into this car in front of me because they don't have any taillights. However, it was almost as though, even those these are cars in front of me, I wasn't in a car. I'm sliding out of control. I don't have the sense that I'm in a car. This seems to replay itself. I see the same thing happen again. I'm back in the dorm. Someone comes in. I say that I'm looking for someone and I say something about this writing essay. One woman chuckled and said, yeah, someone even wondered if that one page was in fact the only reading assignment to write the paper. She asked the rest, if that wasn't ridiculous. I said, well, in their defense, I wondered the same thing myself because it was such a short piece. It seemed that there was more that we needed to read to write the paper about.",someone try kill believe maybe college go building maybe woman dorm go inside see maybe three four people try kill first outside many woman head dorm hear shoot many woman duck ground knee pray know make transition inside next thing know though hung kill yet suspend ceiling wait people think suspend two three woman see sense wait people want kill come start swing try attack whatever suspend next thing know long suspend free roam still sense try kill lingerie something bottom one woman want kill come room ask want fondle think want kill say leave plan go get come back remember actually make plan go plan get come back read store report make phone call ask suppose read resource paper realize soon ask dumb question know suppose read one page thing suppose read write paper felt stupid ask say yes suppose read paper something write use write present something teach something line car car front break light wind hill dark almost run car front taillight however almost though even car front car slide control sense car seem replay see thing happen back dorm someone come say look someone say something write essay one woman chuckle say yeah someone even wonder one page fact read assignment write paper ask rest ridiculous say well defense wonder thing short piece seem need read write paper,13.565759,13.680197,593,4,6,1,4,2,2,3,4,6,9,2

There was some group next to me talking about someone from Anderson. I was nosey, but I realized that I didn't know the person they were talking of. For some reason I wadded up paper and threw it towards a basket. It fell on the floor and the people nearly where it fell looked at me. The music became very strong from the inside. I stood up and looked in. There were four young people playing the piano very hard and loud. Not church music. Someone named Walter Reeder, father-in-law, walked out and handed me an item to take care of, about the size of a shoebox. I didn't know what to do so I left to find other people with the same box to help me. After a long search and some problem crossing the street, I found some men to help. They forced credit cards into sliding slots of the box and a date came up. They said the date was a joke on the owner of the box as to how much money they paid to stay at a hotel.

Noah Wyle, an actor on ER, had found out about something that some of his coworkers were doing that was very wrong. They cornered him and took him to this upstairs location kind of like a loft. They significantly injured him physically, though I don't get the sense that they beat him. It was like they had put some kind of cuffs or something around his wrists and ankles and caused severe abrasions that were about 2 inches wide all the way around on each ankle and wrist. He was bleeding a lot. Down the middle of his chest were severe abrasions. He tried to sneak down to the locker room so he could clean himself up. He was trying to hide it so know one would find out what they had done. He was doing this to protect himself because they had done this to threaten him so he wouldn't report them for what they had done. He was putting on his scrubs and he had tied a whole lot of medications for his injuries tied to a belt. He was trying to hide them under his scrubs. A nurse coming in for her shift happened to look in and saw all the medications. He was talking to someone. That person didn't notice but this nurse did. Before that, I was talking to a supervisor. I guess I worked there. She had told me to check an ad and see if some things were still on sale. I had to stand on a wall heater or something to be able to look at an ad that was posted on the wall. I don't remember what it said but I decided from looking at it that the stuff was not on sale any longer. I never did go back and tell her that. She also wanted me to put out some new things on a shelf. She instructed me that even though the boxes were very attractive that I was to take the things out of the boxes to display them. There was a section of shelves where we displayed over-the-counter medication for employees. We kept them in the boxes. She wanted to make sure that I took these out of the boxes to display them.

I get the sense that I was working with sleep and dreams but that I had to do some time visiting with patients. Going on rounds. I was in a patient's room. It was a double room. They were getting ready to move in a new patient. The new patient was Kay H. She walked in wearing street clothes. She seemed fine, like there was no reason for her to be there. I don't know why she was being admitted. She talked to me a bit and was cheerful. She didn't say that anything was wrong or why she was being admitted. I was on my way somewhere else, so I told her I didn't have time to chat right now. I left. The next thing I know I'm with my fellow students and we're taking a break or relaxing, walking the grounds. I realized that there was a place to play tennis. I went by myself and was looking for a tennis ball. I was going to go. I don't know how I was going to play by myself, because I didn't have a partner. I went to look for a tennis ball. I climbed over a fence or something because I saw these balls and I thought they might be tennis balls. When I got there, they were croquet balls. Then I found this other thing. It was kind of like a small wood cabinet. It had many balls in it and so I started going through there to see if there was a tennis ball in there. There were some in there, but some of them were out of air, flat, some were very small. This young man walked up to me, started talking to me, and started going through there with me. I realized that he was there with another woman. He seemed to be interested in me or maybe just wanted to play tennis with me.

It was somewhat humorous the way I was jumping over things. I can't remember any details of what it was that I was jumping over. I just remember I was making these huge leaps over things to try to get to the hospital on time. I got to my room and I grabbed my white lab coat and put my shoes on. I had been barefoot. I put my shoes and socks on. I said oh my gosh, I still have to go find a stethoscope. I ran to the hospital and went to this one room. There were many different kinds of stethoscopes and other things hanging in rows from the ceiling. There were many different colors. I grabbed a stethoscope and something else and put the stethoscope around my neck. I had a clipboard or notebook and went to find someone. I said I know I'm very late and I'm sorry.

1451,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,64,2000-04-08,"We went on a trip with a group of friends [unknown]. We were in our hotel room/suite, lying on the floor. I was on top of him. We were kissing and laughing. We were having a good time, though it was nothing sexual. Some of the men friends with us came to our room. I decided to go into another room and study for a little while. I had books and papers spread out all over a chair with ottoman, like my black leather on in the living room. I decided it was time to stop studying and get ready to go because we were all going out. I started my shower and got out to get something. When I did, I realized that a couple of the men were waiting to use our bathroom so they could also get ready. I took one of them to our other bathroom so he could use it. The next thing I know I am in the shower and Tom Cu and one of the other men come in the bathroom with me to start getting ready. Tom Cu is upset because Mary Cu said we're all going to be late now. It was my fault because I had waited too long to start getting ready and then tied up the bathroom. I apologized. I got the sense that he wasn't going to stay mad very long.

1464,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,77,2000-04-29,"I was in a small town, and walking home. I hadn't driven there to save money on gas. I don't remember getting there or why I was there. I think this town was one I passed thorough on my way home. I was trying to get to 91st and A1 Road to the west of my home. This town didn't have a 91st St. This doesn't make sense now, but as I was looking for 91st St I saw 92nd and then 101st St. That's when I realized that they didn't have a 91st St. I saw a man on a street. First, I had asked some kids for directions, but their directions didn't make sense to me. Then I asked the man. carrying a duffel bag. He started to tell me one way to get there, but stopped and gave me different directions. He said this was a strange route but the best one. I would go down these steps, the path would go to the left, then I would take the fourth right. That would take me to A1 Road I was looking for. I didn't ask him why it was odd, but repeated the directions back to him to be sure I had it correct. I started on the path, took the left bend, and was faced with a brick door. I pushed the brick door open only to be faced with a few stairs leading up to another door, but that one wouldn't open. I became a bit frightened that I would be trapped so I turned around to go back and get out. When trying to go back I was faced with several of these brick doors. Each time I became a little more panicky that it wouldn't open. I finally got to the steps. At the top of the steps, boards had been nailed sporadically across the opening. I don't remember them being there when I started. There was an opening large enough for me to get out. I ran into the kids again. They couldn't believe he told me to go through the , don't remember what they called it.] They said that if I waited they would just take me to 91st and A1. They checked with their parents and then we left. Before I met the boys or the man the first time, some of the paths I was walking were covered with snow and ice. I was moving my feet and legs as if I was ice-skating but I didn't have skates on. The path was just slick enough that I could skate with my shoes. While the boys were showing me the way, we came to an ice skating rink. The man and his wife were with us now. As we were going in we all got bagels to eat, with different things on them. They told me to just take some of it with me and leave the rest in this little cubbyhole. It was a shelf that reminds me of corporate mailboxes. They each put theirs in one of the cubbies. One boy said especially ones like his because he had icing on his. I didn't do it. I took all of mine with me. We weren't going to skate. just watch. There weren't many people in the stands. Everyone had his or her bagels and a drink sitting on the bleacher seat in front of them. I sat on a row where everyone else had their bagel and drink and I sat mine behind me on a row where others were sitting. I finally said it was time for me to start the rest of the way home. The man and woman were surprised that I would continue to walk. It was dark now and they insisted on driving me. They asked where I lived and assured me it was not an inconvenience. The boys wanted to ride along.

1474,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,87,2000-06-02,"I went to what seemed to be the SVSC though it didn't look like it does in waking life. I'm fairly sure that's where I was. When I arrived, Doctor Bl was in the driveway. I said hello. He smiled and was very warm and friendly as always. He seemed to be doing something that prompted me to ask him if he needed help but he said no. I went inside. I came back outside. Doctor Bl was still there. I think that maybe he was changing a tire on his car. I didn't ask if he needed help, but I looked carefully to see what/how he was doing to try to reassure myself that he didn't need help or that I shouldn't ask before going on. I did say good-bye to him. The driveway was black gravel. As went out into the road, I was traveling by foot. I stood. on purpose. on a crucifix. I was barefoot. I was using the crucifix to slide along the road. almost like a skateboard but the crucifix was smaller than my foot. In fact, I wonder how it worked because it seems that my foot would have grazed the pavement. The pavement of the road was black. maybe asphalt. Anyway, the crucifix worked well for the reason that I was using it. As I was moving along, I came to a hill. I didn't stop. I gave myself a last, hard push and started sailing down the hill. As I started down, I realized the trees almost came together as they branched over the pavement and made it very dark.I couldn't see anything except the tree branches and pitch, black darkness. I was gaining speed as I sped down the hill. There was a part of me that thought I should stop or at the very least slow myself to a very, very slow pace since I couldn't see what I was sailing into or didn't know what as at the other end of the hill. I decided to just keep going. I think I sensed that it would be okay. The road ended abruptly into a grassy pasture. The grass was a beautiful green. The pasture was perhaps 4 acres or more. There were many animals. different kinds. Immediately after I found myself kind of dumped into this grassy area, two horses charged me. They were solid black and beautiful. I didn't run or try to get away from them. I felt slightly fearful at first but then decided to just stand there. I don't remember if I did that because I didn't think they would hurt me or if I thought it would be best or if I just decided to stand still and see what happened. As the horses neared me, they ran aside rather than into me. I turned around a bit, viewing the pasture. It was very beautiful. Soon other groups of animals started charging me, but they all did the same thing as the first two horses. There were pigs and rabbits. One of the groups of rabbits that charged me there were 4-5 rabbits. Soon a large group of horses charged me. This time I was frightened and ran away from them. There were a number of buildings on the far edge of the pasture. That's where I headed when I began to run. I can't recall exactly what all the buildings were. I don't remember specifically a house, a barn, etc. I may be missing some details here. When I was around these buildings, I was with some man that I don't know. I don't recall having any interaction with him, unless it was just a few words. I'm fairly sure I didn't know him. I met a woman. She said something to me as if she knew me. I don't remember what she said. Whatever she said made me realize she was Patty U. However, this woman was tall, and Patty U is only one inch taller than I am. Anyway, I also recognized her dislike of me. I wanted to defend myself but didn't. I wondered how she knew who I was but thought that Barry C must have shown her pictures of me. I thought that was odd but also didn't like it that he had. As I was walking. alone now.I came across Barry C. He was very unpleasant towards me. I don't remember much of what he said to me. I said to him just because I want to have sex, you think I want to have children? I think I assured him that I did not. After telling him that, his attitude seemed to change, but he didn't speak again. I sensed that he wanted us to try again to be together. I walked away. I think I was headed home. This is odd because Barry C lives in CHV. As I was walking along the road, I came across another man who gave me directions and suggested I attend a single's event in town. I realized that I was in CHV and wondered if I wanted to meet someone else so far away. I think I decided to go ahead and stop by and just see what it was like.",go seem svsc though look like wake life fairly sure arrive doctor bl driveway say hello smile warm friendly always seem something prompt ask need help say go inside come back outside doctor bl still think maybe change tire car ask need help look carefully see try reassure need help ask go say good bye driveway black gravel go road travel foot stand purpose crucifix barefoot use crucifix slide along road almost like skateboard crucifix small foot fact wonder work seem foot would graze pavement pavement road black maybe asphalt anyway crucifix work well reason use move along come hill stop give last hard push start sail hill start realize tree almost come together branch pavement make dark see anything except tree branch pitch black darkness gain speed speed hill part think stop least slow slow pace since see sail know end hill decide keep go think sense would okay road end abruptly grassy pasture grass beautiful green pasture perhaps acres many animal different kind immediately find kind dump grassy area two horse charge solid black beautiful run try get away felt slightly fearful first decide stand remember think would hurt thought would best decide stand still see happened horse near ran aside rather turn around bit viewing pasture beautiful soon group animal start charge thing first two horse pig rabbit one group rabbit charge rabbit soon large group horse charge time frighten run away number building far edge pasture head begin run recall exactly build remember specifically house barn etc may miss detail around build man know recall interaction unless word fairly sure know meet woman say something knew remember say whatever say make realize patty however woman tall patty one inch taller anyway also recognize dislike want defend wonder know think barry must show picture think odd also like walk alone come across barry unpleasant towards remember much say say want sex think want child think assure tell attitude seem change speak sense want u try together walk away think head home odd barry live chv walk along road come across another man give direction suggest attend single event town realize chv wonder want meet someone else far away think decide go ahead stop see like,14.0126705,13.405201,905,5,8,3,7,8,7,3,13,10,21,2

There were five or six small children playing with the water hose on the driveway. They were sprinkling each other and had a makeshift water slide. I thought Matthew was with them but when I approached, they dropped the hose and ran away. Matthew wasn't there. There was a pipe protruding from the ground. It had a plastic piece on the end with a kind of screen/filter in it. The diameter was about the size of a quarter. I heard Matthew's voice coming from the pipe. I cupped my hands around the pipe and spoke into it saying, Matthew H, you need to come home right now. I knew he would be embarrassed in front of his friends. I didn't know how else to tell him to come home. I went back inside and lay down on the bed. The radio was on. I felt guilty because there was so much I needed to do.

Jane H was pricing some things to put on the sales floor and Janet S was helping customers. I asked Jane H about her daughter's wedding. She said it is in one week. I asked how Angie Ha is doing and she said fine. I asked about her soon to be son-in-law. She told me that he is a very good guy, but some of his friends were questionable. One of them is an ex-convict. She was still sure that the son-in-law is a very good guy. She was pricing some bright yellow bath towels. I commented about them because they were so large and very thick. They were very nice. She asked if I was interested in them because she used to price things special if she knew I wanted them. I told her I needed to stick to my budget so I better not. She then asked Janet S if she was interested in them. When she held them up for Janet S to look at them they were draperies and not towels. She also told Janet S the size but I don't remember the number exactly. I think it was 13 inches or 18 inches. Janet S decided she wanted them. I decided I needed to leave. As I was on my way out the door. I told them I was on my way to a wedding. I came back in and said it was the wedding of my first of six Godchildren. They were amazed that I had six Godchildren. I noted also that it was the first of my parent's grandchildren to be married. Chuck C was standing at the register preparing to make a purchase. Just after I left the store, I realized that it wasn't the first Godchild but rather the second, thinking that Jody S was the first. I thought I should go back and correct my error but didn't. After leaving the store, I decided I wanted a straw hat for the wedding so I decided to go into this other store and look for one. I accidentally went back into NTNS but hurried back out hoping they didn't see me. When I went into the other store, she had a pile of three or four straw hats on her counter. The straw was beige and the ribbons were black. I decided to buy one even though the ribbon was the wrong color. I left the store. Outside the store, I pulled the black ribbon off and decided that I could buy some pink ribbon so it would coordinate more with my outfit. After leaving the store, I realized I didn't pay her. I ran back and apologized profusely for my oversight. She was very kind about it. I left the store again and headed for my car. The stores were downtown. I was parked under some steel bridges or some such. As I was trying to get to my car I realized a bunch of people, like a large family, were in the way. They were standing along the street and doing something to a baby. Perhaps they were just changing a diaper. The baby had no other clothes on and was very large; not just like a large baby but very large. I'm not sure how to describe it. The baby also looked like it had something all over it that gave its skin a glazed appearance. Just as I approached them, they finished what they were doing and left. I got into my car and left also. As I was driving, I was going very fast, because I realized I was running late. I ran over a curb on my left side. It was the kind that divides two-way traffic. I had to drive strangely to get back over the curb and onto the road properly. I worried that I would ruin a tire doing this but I didn't. Other cars were headed straight at me and had to drive to miss me. I think I was still on the right side of the road. I had the sense that it was the fact that I was in such a hurry that was causing the problem not that I was in a wrong lane. A van pulled cross ways in front of me and then drove up into a grassy hill to avoid being hit and then back onto the road behind me. I had the sense that they had been trying to merge with traffic and pulled out to far without there being adequate room for them to pull out properly so they had to make this maneuver to avoid being hit by me. It was their inappropriate driving that caused their situation not mine. As I continued to drive, I was thinking how much I hate driving downtown because I hate driving this route. I suddenly realized I had missed my exit. Shortly after that, the road became train tracks and I was the only one there. Instead of driving a car my vehicle was suddenly a semi-tractor with a chain of trailers. Instead of driving it, however, I was pushing it. It was full size and I was normal size yet I was pushing it as though I was a child playing with a toy truck. I was still hurrying because I knew I was especially late now that I had missed my turn and ran into this unexpected obstacle. As I continued to push the truck, it started to go underneath a train. I'm not sure how that would be possible. This lends itself to this on-going oddity of sizes. I pulled the truck back out from under the train and lifted it onto the next set of tracks. I eventually came to a tollbooth. There were several lanes and all were full so I got in line. Most of the other trucks had the drivers inside them but I was still outside and behind of mine. As it became my turn at the tollbooth, I pushed my truck through. It went rolling down the hill and into the highway. It was a regular highway again now. I was still waiting for the tollbooth agent so I could pay my toll. I was trying to keep an eye on my truck so I knew where it headed. I was wondering if I would be able to catch it. I saw it take an exit ramp. It was in the middle of quite a bit of traffic and seemed to be doing just fine without a driver. You would think a capable driver were at the wheel. While I was waiting to pay the toll, I saw another driver outside of his truck in the same situation. His truck had gone ahead without him. He was dancing around at the tollbooth trying to get the agent to hurry so he could catch his truck as well. I don't know why, but at this point I felt reassured that I would be able to catch my truck.",ntns talk jane janet speak mostly jane usual jane price thing put sale floor janet help customer ask jane daughter wed say one week ask angie ha say fine ask soon son law tell good guy friend questionable one ex convict still sure son law good guy pricing bright yellow bath towel comment large thick nice ask interested used price thing special know want tell need stick budget well ask janet interested hold janet look drapery towel also tell janet size remember number exactly think inch inch janet decide want decide need leave way door tell way wedding come back say wed first six godchild amaze six godchild note also first parent grandchild marry chuck stand register prepare make purchase leave store realize first godchild rather second think jody first think go back correct error leave store decide want straw hat wed decide go store look one accidentally go back ntns hurry back hop see go store pile three four straw hat counter straw beige ribbon black decide buy one even though ribbon wrong color leave store outside store pull black ribbon decide could buy pink ribbon would coordinate outfit leave store realize pay run back apologize profusely oversight kind leave store head car store downtown park steel bridge try get car realize bunch people like large family way stand along street something baby perhaps change diaper baby clothes large like large baby large sure describe baby also look like something give skin glaze appearance approach finish leave got car leave also drive go fast realize run late run curb leave side kind divide two way traffic drive strangely get back curb onto road properly worry would ruin tire car head straight drive miss think still right side road sense fact hurry cause problem wrong lane van pull cross way front drive grassy hill avoid hit back onto road behind sense try merge traffic pull far without adequate room pull properly make maneuver avoid hit inappropriate driving cause situation mine continue drive thinking much hate drive downtown hate drive route suddenly realize missed exit shortly road become train track one instead drive car vehicle suddenly semi tractor chain trailer instead drive however push full size normal size yet push though child play toy truck still hurry know especially late miss turn ran unexpected obstacle continue push truck start go underneath train sure would possible lends go oddity size pull truck back train lift onto next set track eventually come tollbooth several lane full get line truck driver inside still outside behind mine become turn tollbooth push truck go roll hill highway regular highway still wait tollbooth agent could pay toll try keep eye truck know head wonder would able catch saw take exit ramp middle quite bit traffic seem fine without driver would think capable driver wheel wait pay toll saw another driver outside truck situation truck go ahead without dance around tollbooth try get agent hurry could catch truck well know point felt reassure would able catch truck,14.009047,13.318064,1210,7,12,7,8,9,14,7,9,20,20,2

Two women that I worked for took another female coworker and me to another room to train us on closing out the paperwork and money. I did the paperwork while the other woman counted the money. I had completed some of the papers earlier but had done them partially wrong. I saw that they had used a black marker and crossed out the info that was wrong. It was personal information, like maiden name and such I think. I had to recount the money to verify from the first woman. I had trouble doing that because she had put loose change and bills in with other money so I couldn't count it, but I didn't say anything.

1488,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,101,2000-07-09,"There was something oddly familiar about this. I was at a meeting. I think at the hospital. I felt like I had been at this meeting before. There were several large round tables. Doctor Bl was sitting at one of those tables. I sat at another. Someone was sitting on both sides of him, though there was an empty chair at his table. We had been given manuals by the presenter to follow along. The pages were glossy and the colors were shades of beige/brown/gold. The man I was sitting next to had his book open to a different page than I did. Doctor Bl's was open to a still different page. I changed mine to the same page as Doctor Bl. The man next to me, whom I felt was superior in some way, told me that was wrong. That page said 1999-2000 goals and objectives. The man next to me finally convinced me it was the wrong page so I turned to the page he was on. I was walking outside, back to the meeting. Another woman walked up alongside me and took my hand. I asked her if we had met at this same meeting the last time. She said yes. She appeared older than me, with very full, shoulder length, straight, salt and pepper hair. I never did see her face. She was getting ready to take lunch to a group of people. It was part of, or an exercise of, this meeting. She stated that she had done it the last time and found it very rewarding. We had the option to take lunch to someone or to have a spiritual lunch by ourselves. She left and I prepared my car/mini-van to take lunch to some people. I had the car running and the AC running so it would cool off. It was a beautiful summer day. I remember how green the grass was. As I was doing this I felt excited like it was a very good think to do and that I would enjoy it. Then I saw other people sitting in the grass and eating lunch alone or in pairs.

It was as if we didn't know what to talk about. There was food everywhere, almost as if it was on display just for people to take and eat. Lots of sweets especially. At some point Mother, Bev, and Rachel S were there too. We were mostly playing with Rachel S. Bev had a clip-on ponytail for her that Rachel S wouldn't let us put on her. However, it was very cute. She also had this little pair of eyeglasses, which she also wouldn't keep on. Chris C sold insurance. Once we got to his house, he sat in a wheelchair to make it easier to get around. Even though we didn't talk much, I suggested we get together more often. I was trying to be nice because I felt he was very lonely. He seemed to be appreciative of the offer to get together more often. I told him we had one staircase and then wondered what I was thinking and said we could get by without using it. Again, he seemed happy for the offer. I asked him what kind of insurance he sells so I could refer people to him. He said all kinds. At some point Brian F showed up. He couldn't believe all the food. He wanted some but didn't take any. I very much wanted a cream filled donut, but didn't take one. I did take a snickerdoodle. I didn't want Chris C to see that I had it even though he had told us to help ourselves. When we were getting ready to go, he loaded up this big basket/cart full of food for Bev. The items I remember were three boxes of tea, larger than VCR's. I also asked about his apartment Community to see if it was adults. I told him I was thinking about a new apartment where it would be adults only. As we were leaving in the car I realized I had looked at them once before and didn't care for them.

Barry C was there but I don't know how involved he was. I started driving home and saw the Catholic Church. It's quite possible in waking life, but I was in TH and CHV. Not sure how to explain except that I was in downtown TH and their church. I was driving through downtown CHV to go meet Barry C. When I saw the church, it had many beautiful stained glass windows. I decided that I had to stop for just a minute. I saw Reagan U and she told me where to park. I was concerned because it didn't seem like an appropriate place but she assured met hat it was and why. Something like, if anyone asks, she would make a certain gesture and they would then understand. She went into the church with me. It was as though five Masses were going on. It was not beautiful inside. I was wondering why I had gone on so to Reagan U about how beautiful it was. On the outside, I had seen these beautiful stained-glass windows. I was looking around inside trying to find them. I decided I needed to go bed because Barry C would be waiting. Reagan U left with me. We were sitting on an open-air vehicle of some kind. A man came running out shouting Good News! Good news! I was saying something like that referring to God. Several other men followed him. They were carrying Mass cups of wine. They approached our vehicle. The first man was short, blonde hair. Later, I realized that is the man Reagan U is secretly in love with. One of the men was Ernest Hartman. I drank from his cup. The next thing I knew I was back in my car trying to figure out how to get to where I was meeting Barry C. I guess I was on a cell phone because he said he was going to double back to Druiz St. to turn on the street that we both needed to be on. Right after that, I crossed over Druiz St. and realized I missed it and had to go back also. Maybe some of this was before the church. I think I got lost and this is when I saw the church. After the church, and back in my car, I saw Reagan U in her car and realized she was going to lead me to where I needed to be. I think I was driving to fast because I had to go over two lanes, into a left turn lane, to keep from rear-ending her. My first thought was how I was going to get back behind her. Then I thought I should just give her an okay sign with my fingers and find it on my own. I also realized Barry C would be wondering where I was since I was taking so long. I also realized that I didn't know where we were meeting, only the street.

Somewhere along the line, someone suggested I interview to be the store manager again. I asked about the current JLI members to see if there was anyone around who would remember me. I was inside the shop but it was jut a very small room, like a small living room. There was very little merchandise. Jane H and Janet S said that's all there was. They gave the impression that there was concern that the store might have to close. There were several colors. The one that sticks in my head is red. There were two very cool pieces of furniture. I'm not sure if they were really pieces of furniture. One of them reminded me of a miniature of Grandma F's wardrobe. The other was similar, larger, and yet different. One was marked $300 and the other $130. Jane H was marking them down and making it sound as though they should already have been marked down but I wondered if she was just doing it for me, as she often does in waking life.

I decided to go downstairs. To go downstairs I had to go through a square opening, the type you might find to enter an attic. The steps were more like a ladder. When I got down there it was almost like a cement maze. There were many people running around. There were plain-clothes police officers running frantically with guns. I crouched into a corner just as a police officer leaned against the wall over me and began shooting. A large group of men approached me, also trying to avoid being hurt, and crouched into the corner around me. We were being attacked by Russians. Some Russians found us and began shooting. It seemed that quite a few of the men around me were hit and some killed. At first, I thought they hit everyone but me and I thought about how there were enough men around me to keep me from being hit. At the same time, it almost seemed as though I had been hit also. I didn't feel any pain or anguish as I might have had I actually been hit. The next thing I know Matthew and I had been captured. We were assigned to sleeping quarters. Our sleeping quarters were oblong cement square holes in a wall. Each person had his or her own square. There was barely enough room to move. I was especially concerned about how tight it would be for me. They then gave us pajamas, or it may have been a uniform to change into. We were expected to change in our sleeping quarters.

I went to sit down for breakfast. Julien D was there eating a bowl of cereal. They looked like colored cornball cereal. He looked at me and said, Vas is los?

1508,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,121,2000-08-25,"I was at a two-story house with many people around. There was a wood deck on the second floor with wood steps leading up to it. There was a child sitting on the edge of the deck making something creepy. Maybe something to look like mice? He was throwing them into the grass below. His mom said that what he was making and doing was very good. I had a very strange looking red tooth and there was a gap all around it. She asked me if it was real. I took it out and you could see it was plastic. It's as if I was looking at my own mouth but I didn't have a mirror. I also know the tooth wasn't real but when I pulled it out and saw it was plastic I guess it confirmed to me that it wasn't real. I put it back on. I noticed something about her dress and ran my finger along part of it. I realized that parts of her were not real either. Then there was a man sitting in a red convertible with a woman. He had apparently been practicing working on ears. He had a pair of very long surgical tweezers. He reached in her ear I think, and pulled something out. Then he said, see I can do it. They were sitting in a huge room that was very bright and sterile looking. There were other cars parked in there also. The woman was in the driver seat of this car. She was there to get her ear worked on. Someone came up, opened her car door, took her whole seat out with her still sitting in it and stuck it out the inside of her car door. The door had all kinds of wires and things showing. They put her there to work on her ear. I was in a room with wood floors and walls. The wood looked like what you see in a barn or a very rustic house. A little boy set rat free in the room. In waking life, I would have been very frightened and distraught about this. Here I stood in place and first moved slightly trying to avoid the rat. I hated it, but was trying to stay in control and not let it make me panic or scream. I thought I was doing pretty well but then it started to fly in circles around me. I started to panic a little and started swinging at it with something white.

It was decided, though I don't think everyone agreed, that it was a 24-hour drive and so we would go. I don't remember actually giving the lecture. At the end of the lecture, all five of us sat around a table, yet all facing the audience, to answer audience questions. I ended up behind some of the others.

1517,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,130,2000-10-21,"We are out sightseeing in this little town. It is fall, I think maybe late October, like around Halloween. I am with a man named Daniel [unknown in waking life]. He is tall, thin, with blondish-brown hair. He is very kind and yet very strong personally. We have a bunch of children with us. I think we are just sightseeing and such. We see this man sitting in a chair. I think he was playing music. His pants are unzipped and his penis is showing. As I notice it, his erect penis comes completely out of his pants and is laying flat against the chair. Right after this happens something black, reminds me of a worm but it wasn't that, slides down the length of his penis and disappears. I thought it was nasty and wondered what it was. As Daniel, I, and the children are sightseeing, we are participating in lots of local activities. It is a very small town, smaller than St. Joe, where everyone knows each other, gets along well together, and does many fun things together. We join them in some kind of choral concert. We, or the children, are singing with them. I feel more as if I am observing than participating but I'm fairly sure the children were participating. It feels as though Daniel and I are taking an open carriage ride in the early evening, though it is dark. We are talking about how wonderful and beautiful it is there and how great it would be to live there. We talk especially about what it would be like in the winter, with the snow, and at Christmas. It wasn't snowing, the leaves had all turned colors, it was beautiful, and the air was crisp and cool. Yet, I had a very clear picture of the area after a large snow. I could literally see it. I saw a couple of men clearing snow from their cars. One has a shovel and seems to be trying to get snow out from under the front driver's side wheel well. Then I'm back to reality and noticing the beautiful fall colors again. I notice two little tiny people in a tree. One male and one female. They are maybe only two inches tall. I have a sense that I see them and yet at this time I also feel like I might be the female. It may be that the male lives in that tree but the female is just there, visiting. They are somewhat concerned, but not terribly, but something that is happening. The tree begins to shake. A little bit later, Daniel and I are back with the children doing something else. One of the children finds two little flat things lying on the ground. They appear to be the kind of plastic clear and color decals that I put on my windows at Christmas time. These look like the two tiny people. We realize that whatever happened to the tree did this to them, that the two little things, were actually these people and they were now gone for good. It was sad and yet okay both. There is another adult. We called him Cooter. He is in the car with Daniel and a little girl. He said something to the little girl about Uncle Cooter always being there for her. The next thing I know Daniel and I are back home, to my home, with the children. It is a very lovely middle-class home. We try to get all the children into bed. I don't know where Cooter is at this time. I am observing this and yet at the same time feel as though I am the woman. I go to the other end of the house. It seems to be a long house because there seems to be quite a distance between the children's room and my room. Daniel came into my room. I am already dressed for bed in a spaghetti strap satin full-length nightgown. I lay down on top of the blankets. Daniel lies down with me and is holding me. We are discussing him staying there with me. possibly marriage. living with us. I get the sense that the children are foster children. There are a number of boys and I think just one girl. This next part is weird but I will explain as best I can. I suddenly feel as though I am Daniel and that I am holding the woman. I am holding her in a way that my right arm is running parallel to and cupping her legs, buttocks, and back. It's kind of like I am a huge person and at the same time this entire part of her body is the same size as the length of my arm. There is also the sense that I am holding both the woman and Daniel. I think we finally decide that we will give it a go. sharing the home and love of and care for the children. I don't know if that means marriage or simply living together though. It almost seems this is another scene but there is discussion about Cooter and what will happen to him. He doesn't have a place to live. My first thought is to turn a shed in the back yard into a bedroom. I realize then that he would be coming in and out of the house using our kitchen, bathrooms, etc, and we Daniel and I wouldn't have any privacy that way. I suggest that we build him an apartment over the garage.",sightsee little town fall think maybe late october like around halloween man name daniel unknown wake life tall thin blondish brown hair kind yet strong personally bunch child u think sightsee see man sit chair think play music pant unzip penis show notice erect penis come completely pant lay flat chair right happen something black remind worm slide length penis disappear think nasty wonder daniel child sightsee participate lot local activity small town small st joe everyone know get along well together many fun thing together join kind choral concert child sing feel observe participate fairly sure child participate feel though daniel take open carriage ride early even though dark talk wonderful beautiful great would live talk especially would like winter snow christmas snow leaf turn color beautiful air crisp cool yet clear picture area large snow could literally see saw couple men clear snow car one shovel seem try get snow front driver side wheel well back reality notice beautiful fall color notice two little tiny people tree one male one female maybe two inch tall sense see yet time also feel like might female may male life tree female visit somewhat concern terribly something happen tree begin shake little bit later daniel back child something else one child find two little flat thing lie ground appear kind plastic clear color decal put window christmas time look like two tiny people realize whatever happen tree two little thing actually people go good sad yet okay another adult call cooter car daniel little girl say something little girl uncle cooter always next thing know daniel back home home child lovely middle class home try get child bed know cooter time observe yet time feel though woman go end house seem long house seem quite distance child room room daniel come room already dress bed spaghetti strap satin full length nightgown lay top blanket daniel lie hold discus stay possibly marriage live u get sense child foster child number boy think one girl next part weird explain best suddenly feel though daniel hold woman hold way right arm run parallel cup leg buttock back kind like huge person time entire part body size length arm also sense hold woman daniel think finally decide give go share home love care child know mean marriage simply live together though almost seem another scene discussion cooter happen place live first think turn shed back yard bedroom realize would come house use kitchen bathroom etc daniel privacy way suggest build apartment garage,13.957784,13.450026,943,3,14,6,4,12,10,7,13,12,25,2
1518,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,131,2000-10-22,"It was the morning of October 21, 2000. I was at this large, old house. 2-3 people showed up for the first regional conference. They had not pre-registered but rather just showed up hoping to get in. I explained to them that the event had been cancelled and I think they left but I'm not sure. The next thing I know there are 50 or more people there for the same reason. Wanting to attend but not having pre-registered. I had them all take a seat at tables. The tables were all like dining tables and set up with dinnerware for a meal. I climbed halfway up this very wide staircase to speak to the people. I said, I am vertically challenged so I'm going to stand up here to help you hear me. They all chuckled. I announced that there had been a problem with the mailing and so we had cancelled the event. Since there were so many of them there, we were going to see what we could do to accommodate them. I explained that there was no way we could get Bart H there at this late notice, but I would see if we could get Barry C on an immediate flight. I also stated that my presentation would be different since I did not have the proper AV equipment. I was thinking that I would only tell them that much although I was worrying about it because I had not finished preparing that talk. I was also trying to figure out what we were going to do about food, etc. I didn't mention anything about vendors because I knew there was nothing that could be done about that. I noted that two of the people who had signed in were people who had worked with dreams and I think I knew them. I had asked one of them if he could make a presentation to fill in the space allotted for Bart H. Somehow the other one got the message that I had asked for him. I decided that was fine. Regarding the food, at first I thought I would have to just tell them they would be on their own for lunch. A little later, I thought I about doing something simple that could be done last minute like calling Subway to deliver. That way we could still do the lunchtime dream discussion groups. I told the people who were there that I would figure out an adjusted price due to the circumstances. I thought a little more about what would be involved to get Barry C here. I thought he would surely have some money in a savings account that he could pay his expenses just until he got there and then I could reimburse him. I would have to tell him not to call Continental just to use his $100 voucher but try to find the best airfare for the time he needed. I would also tell him to just take a cab when he gets here and I would reimburse him for that as well. He might have to take a cab from his home to the CHV airport as well. I think I woke up more than once in the middle of this dream [unless I was simply lucid] thinking I can't believe that this is a dream and the event was supposed to be yesterday.

1523,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,136,2000-10-28,"I went to a hotel somewhere to be with Daniel R. While I was there, I realized Aimee F was also there to be with Daniel R. Of course, I was upset. I was in a huge hotel room suite that had two bathrooms. I went into one bathroom and Daniel R was in there taking a bath. I went into the other bathroom and there was someone who looked exactly like him also taking a bath. I realized at that point that he had a twin. While they were in the bathtubs, they were both drinking and smoking cigars. Later I realized he was one of triplets, not twins. I knew now that Aimee F was there for Daniel R's twin. I think we were in Las Vegas. I believe we went to dinner with a group of people. Daniel R sat next to me though he hardly said anything to me the entire time. Even when he did, it was things that sounded like he was making fun of me, as he used to do in waking life. Something happened, maybe Daniel R's comment, that made me realize I did not want to be with him any more. I realized that I deserved better than this. However, I was afraid of what he might do if I tried to leave. So I was trying to figure out a way to sneak out. Aimee F had decided to stay. She thought she could get what she wanted out of the relationship with the twin without doing anything she didn't want to do. There were two other men who worked for Daniel R who were going to help me sneak out. I packed my suitcases. I went into this elevator. I don't remember exactly how this happened but the elevator turned sideways and I slid out rather than stepping out like you normally would. It wasn't dangerous or scary. I just remember thinking how odd it was. As I was leaving, there was a large crowd of people gathered for some event. I saw the top of Daniel R's head but was sure he didn't see me.

1524,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,137,2000-11-09,"I was in a very large dining facility to give a dream lecture. I was trying to figure out the best place for me to stand to speak so that everyone in the facility would be able to hear me. I saw no place for me to stand so that everyone could see me. This was the shape of the room. I stood on a chair thinking that would help. It was a metal folding chair. I told the crowd that I was trying to find a way that they would all hear me. Everyone was sitting at dining tables eating. Right after I got up on the chair, people started moving around finding different places to sit. All of the people from one of the ells came and sat on the floor in the main area. I said, Good, I didn't feel very safe on this chair in these heels. I looked down, thinking I had on high heels. I had on red shoes with a little heel, but they were not high heels. I mumble something like well they wouldn't have been so bad. There was a fourth part of the room, where the double arrows are, that seemed like it might have been a bar. There were employees of the facility in that area but I don't recall seeing anyone else. Before I started giving my talk, I asked one of the men in the room to take some occasional pictures for me, as I needed them for PR purposes. I showed him how to work my camera. He seemed perfectly okay with doing that. not put out or hassled or anything. I didn't notice him taking any pictures after that. I asked the crowd, What are dreams? A man walked by me and gave me a scientific answer. I laughed and said, You're absolutely right! Still chuckling, I said I've never gotten that answer before, but you are absolutely right! The crowd laughed too. A few other people gave me answers. I was going through explanations of why I was not addressing the scientific explanation of dreams. My explanation included the fact that I am right-brained. though I went through a little mental conversation to get to this phrase. The explanation also included the fact that when I go into scientific explanations I prefer to have my notes in front of me. This likely relates to the scientific aspects of my work and how I feel about talking about scientific and physiological explanations of things there. I then asked, What is the purpose of dreams? I got several answers but none that I was looking for. Therefore, I gave them five purposes of dreams. They included wish fulfillment and playtime. I don't remember now what the other three reasons were that I gave them. I had a heavy stack of 8 x 14 paper in my arms that had things printed on them. notes and pictures for my talk. I was trying to use them as notes but they were too heavy and awkward to hold as I was walking around the room talking so I put them down. I kept the top sheet that I was talking about at that time. It had several pictures on it. Each picture had words on it. The one picture I was currently talking about had something to do with Freud and some of the words were in Spanish and/or French. I read the words, stumbling over them a bit. The man taking pictures for me also read it aloud, much more clearly than I did. I think he said it would be much easier if you knew a foreign language. [Somehow I got this message but I'm not sure how.] I have a sense that the talk went very well. I felt on. I felt the high that I do when I have given a talk that has gone very well and been received very well. The audience seemed to be enjoying themselves. I think this area might be part of a hotel but I'm not sure. Either earlier or in a prior dream last night I was at the hotel. I only remember that I had been at that place or hotel earlier. I don't even know if I left and came back or if I was staying at the hotel for the purpose of giving this talk.

1526,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,139,2000-11-11,"I was in this very large house. It belonged to very wealthy people. Some young people were having a party here. I don't think their parents knew about it. Perhaps it was an after-prom party, but I'm not sure. Many of the kids were making-out in several of the rooms. Particularly, I found a couple in one of the bedrooms. I was wondering through the house, simply because it was such a large, expensive home and I was interested in seeing all the rooms. I would go up a flight of stairs and the only room would be another bedroom. Another flight of stairs, one bedroom. Etc. I did this several times. On one floor of the building, the bedroom was all white, the furnishings, and everything. It was more like a suite. The front room, I think, was the bathroom and then led into the area where the bed was. In the bed area, the walls seemed to be covered with white billowy curtains. For some reason, I think there were two beds, side by side, instead of one. This doesn't make sense to me because this is the room where the owners of the house would go to make love. Maybe I'm not remembering it right but it just doesn't feel right. I don't know if it was one large bed or two twin beds. Anyway, the bed(s) face an extremely large Jacuzzi. It is the walls around the Jacuzzi that have the white billowy curtains. I thought what a beautiful room this was. But there were no other furnishings or decorations in this room. Just the beds, the Jacuzzi, and the curtains. I think I may have been with someone as I was later checking all the rooms. I don't know if I was checking to make sure everyone was gone or if I was looking for someone.

1530,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,143,2000-11-26,"I was driving in a seemingly unfamiliar town. I decided to drive down C Street as I thought I would find something at the end of that street that I might be interested in. As I neared the end of C Street, I decided that I should probably cross over to D Street. As I was preparing to do that, I passed Cox's. I'm not sure what it was. maybe a factory. I said to myself, Oh yes! I remember them. I think that maybe I worked in the office there for a short time. As I was driving by, I saw a man come out the door with his adult son. The son was mentally handicapped. I said to myself, I remember them, too. He always used to take his son to work and pick him up again. The only difference is that people knew about his disability and they didn't know about mine. I kept driving. As I was driving through the city streets, I realized that I had to merge into the left lane because there was a police car up ahead of me and there was a man dressed in brown lying on the street behind the police car. I was watching the traffic trying to get over and I got very, very close to the police car. I was able to stop before hitting it. The police officer looked up and gave me a dirty look. I backed up and went around. As I went around, however, I noticed that the man was no longer there. I was now walking on the sidewalk instead of driving. I noticed that this town had a section of stores that was more or less New Age. I decided to go into one of them. It was a clothing store. The name was Wicca Fashions or something with the name Wicca in it. As I was in there browsing, I came across some exercise clothing. One of the sales clerks approached me and encouraged me to try it on. From looking at it, I couldn't believe that I would like the way it looked on me. It was two piece, knit, tight fitting, and grey. I went ahead and took one off the rack and started to the dressing room. As I did so, Ruth M came in to see me or to wait for me. To go into the dressing room was a very narrow hallway and one with several twists and turns. I had to back against the wall and squeeze through around each wall. As I got in, I realized that it was also a bathroom and the stalls were very small as well. The sales clerk had come in with me. As I was putting the outfit on she was using the bathroom, she called, by phone, to the front of the store, and told someone we needed more toilet paper. I was totally shocked when I put the outfit on. It was totally sheer, like stockings. I was surprised that as far as my figure was concerned it didn't look bad but I didn't like the sheer aspect at all. I pointed out to the sales clerk how clearly my varicose veins, which I don't have, could be seen. They were quite significant and primarily on one buttock and on an outer thigh. The sales clerk, of course, thought it looked great and tried to say that the sheerness didn't matter. I told her I needed to get back out to my friend that was waiting on me.",drive seemingly unfamiliar town decide drive street think would find something end street might interest neared end street decide probably cross street prepare pas cox sure maybe factory say oh yes remember think maybe work office short time drive saw man come door adult son son mentally handicap say remember always use take son work pick difference people know disability know mine keep drive drive city street realize merge leave lane police car ahead man dress brown lie street behind police car watch traffic try get get close police car able stop hit police officer look give dirty look back go around go around however notice man longer walk sidewalk instead drive notice town section store less new age decide go one clothing store name wicca fashion something name wicca browse come across exercise clothing one sale clerk approach encourage try look believe would like way look two piece knit tight fit grey go ahead take one rack start dress room ruth come see wait go dressing room narrow hallway one several twist turn back wall squeeze around wall get realize also bathroom stall small well sale clerk come put outfit use bathroom call phone front store tell someone need toilet paper totally shock put outfit totally sheer like stock surprise far figure concerned look bad like sheer aspect point sale clerk clearly varicose vein could see quite significant primarily one buttock outer thigh sale clerk course think look great tried say sheerness matter tell need get back friend waiting,14.015486,13.216109,602,3,6,5,4,2,6,1,4,10,10,2

When we started painting, we did just a little bit under the windowsill to see how it would look after it dried. The next morning we looked at it and it was a yellowish-beige instead of teal. I took a razor blade and started scraping off the top layer, which exposed the teal. But the teal part was somewhat wet and left it looking rough or textured rather than smooth. I said, well, we could make it work this way. Then Matthew, or perhaps someone else, found the problem and pointed it out. It says to use egg noodles and the ones we used weren't egg. I ate some of the non-egg noodles and then rinsed my mouth as though I had just brushed my teeth. I brushed them over and over again.

1536,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,149,2000-12-03,"I was walking around this one section of town. The town reminded me of my mother's hometown. I was trying to get some Avon orders to supplement my income since I don't have a regular job right now. I thought that perhaps I should get some books and start working the area for a while until I get another job. As I was walking, I was trying to identify the houses that I know had bought from me before. I walked across these two piles of firewood, stacked side-by-side, belonging to two different families. While I was doing that, some of the wood from a third pile rolled own a small embankment. I didn't go pick it up, convincing myself that it wasn't my fault. I walked by one house and there were many people inside. They might be having a party, so I started to walk on by. They had long rows of small cages with rabbits in them. I saw an opening where I thought I could walk between them but realized there was something overhead and I would have to get on my hands and knees to get through. About that time, the woman that lived there came out and wanted to know why I was there. I told her. She said the only Avon she buys is reorder stuff. I said, Okay. Thanks. Then I left. At this point, there are two other Avon reps walking with me. The woman who owns the woodpile walks up and talks about having to pick it all up. I didn't realize who she was or what she was talking about until she left and the other three of us walked past there again and I saw the little plastic fence messed up. I fixed the fence, put it back in place, but still didn't say it was my fault. On the other side of the fence was a long row of flowers. They looked like they were something special. They were tied up with string that was held up by poles to keep the string 8-12 inches above the ground. I was glad the wood hadn't hurt any of the flowers, but still didn't say anything. We continued walking. We came to a large rack with rows of pullout shelves. It had a few very small potted plants on them. The two women I was with turned some of them on their side so the Avon person responsible for them would know to throw them away.

1537,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,150,2000-12-06,"There were mice in the apartment. They were mostly visible running between the wall and the layer of paint. I watched one run across the ceiling just under the paint, another down the wall, the same way. However when that one came to the floor it ran out and across the floor. Matthew sat something on it and smashed it. I was upset that it was there but also that Matthew had killed it. When he looked, though, it wasn't dead. He went ahead and killed it because it was so injured. I called the apartment office and told them about the problem. I asked if they would call an exterminator. I told them that I had already paid for an exterminator once. I also told them I went through two cans of bug spray trying to get rid of all the ants here. I don't remember if they answered me. I also called someone to get a quote on replacing my carpet and linoleum. I had gotten a quote from this man before, but I didn't tell him that until he got here. Then I tried to make some excuse for not telling him before. We talked about the kitchen first. The floor was divided into three sections. Each section was a different kind of flooring. He brought a woman with him. He said they couldn't do anything to the wood. I said that was fine. I wanted to keep it anyway. They asked about the parquet and I said I wanted it changed. They tore up one corner of the linoleum. They finished the quote. It was about $2300. I knew I couldn't afford that so I was wondering if I could afford part of it and if so which parts to do. I noticed the floor they had torn up in the kitchen. The gold sculpture carpet in the living room and the green carpet in the hallway. I then remembered that the apartment manager would be replacing it in less than a year. I wondered if I should just wait. But I wanted it to look good for the dream groups I will be starting in January. There was also something about me being at the office talking to Laura Bu. There was row/wall of windows that were different shapes and sizes. When I looked a second time, some of the windows were screens. I was talking to Laura Bu through one of the screens. I also remember that going into the house with the man for a carpet quote, we had to go up a set of steps. There were two separate sets. Both were very high and I directed him to enter through the ones that were less high. I couldn't just step into them.

1539,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,152,2000-12-26,"I was preparing to get married. I don't think I was marrying him for love as part of an undercover plan. He was an extremely wealthy man with a very large estate. He seemed apprehensive about whether the plan would work or not. His estate consisted of a number of buildings. There were quite a number of people who were unhappy about the marriage, including all of my bridesmaids. All of the bridesmaids were not even my friends but acquaintances of his or of the people planning the wedding. The bridesmaids seemed to dislike me/or at least be very upset with me that I was marrying this man. I had gotten dressed for the wedding, traditional wedding gown, and stuck my make-up bag in a pocket of my gown and went to the building where the wedding was to be held. It was not a church. I saw several of the bridesmaids standing around. There were quite a few of them. Maybe even twelve. Their dresses were very simple and elegant, satin and a kind of purple/blue color. They were all very rude to me because they did not like it that I was marrying this man. I rushed into a small room to put my make-up on. Just as I was finishing someone came in to tell me it was time and ask if I was ready. I said I was ready when they were. I left that room and found that several of my bridesmaids were out of place. One was lying down on a bed complaining of cramps another was out of place but I don't remember what her problem was. I told them we would go on without them. As I got to the room where the wedding was being held the bridesmaids had all gone down the aisle already and it was my turn. As I entered the room, I nodded to someone and an usher seated one last couple. I am assuming now that it was the groom's parents. As I was walking down the aisle, I noticed that the room was full of celebrity's. I noticed Michael Jackson wearing a black jacket with circles on it made of gold threads and Elvis Presley. As I got to the end of the aisle there was another couple standing there, waiting to be married. I didn't know before then that it was going to be a double ceremony but I just stepped to the side to stand next to them. As I did someone told me I had to move all the way down to make room for the other couples. A rock band got up right in front of me and started playing. I started to get upset because I didn't like all of these surprises, especially things that I would not have at my wedding, like bridesmaids that were not my friends, other people marrying at the same time, the rock band. My fiance and I left the room without being married. We were standing out side talking. We suddenly kissed very long and hard and realized at that time that we truly did love each other. I felt that I was the male and had initiated the kiss and was a bit taller than the woman was. We are lying under this giant hamburger. It almost seems as though we were lying in a grill but it wasn't hot or anything. We were eating the hamburger, laughing and having a good time. The hamburger had cole slaw covering the top of it.

1540,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,153,2000-12-27,"I was in a department store with Margie D. We were in the linen section. She was looking at slipcovers and commented to me that she was thinking of getting one. I told her that I had recently purchased them for both my sofa and my oversized chair. I also said that while they didn't fit exactly right because of the low arms on my sofa, I am pretty happy with them. I don't remember if I mentioned the color or not. I recall seeing the linens. They were all solid colors, deep colors like navy, forest green, burgundy, etc. While we were looking, I noticed two small girls came up to a screen door and said something to someone in the store. I noticed the man they were speaking with. After they left, I asked him if they were his daughters and he said yes. I commented that they were very cute. As he walked away, I thought he was an attractive man. Then I reminded myself that this was Ernie C I was talking about, and I did not want to get involved with him. The man didn't look like Ernie C until he began to walk away and it wasn't until then that I noted that it was he. Prior to that, I was not familiar with the man. Since Margie D was still looking, I told her I was going to another part of the store and would be back. I put a question mark after store because the environment seems to be confused between being a store and being an office. I'm not sure if it changes or if I just don't know for sure which it is. As I was walking around, I saw Tonya H but didn't get a chance to speak to her. I kept walking and saw my old office at the sleep center. I took a few steps back to look in because I noticed that they had taken a wall out and made one much larger office. When I looked into the office I noticed that they had made this space the office space and had five chairs lined up in a row along a table. This was their workspace. It was very close. They barely had room to move without touching each other. There were three of six people sitting there working. Two of them I did not know. One of them was Lilly H. I asked her how she liked her new space. I said it somewhat sarcastically because I guessed she probably didn't. I tried not to be too sarcastic though because I didn't know the other two people sitting there. She gave me a guarded answer for the same reason but I realized that my suspicion was right. she didn't like the new arrangements. I noticed a baby lying on a blanket on the floor on its back playing. Even though the baby was Caucasian I asked Lilly H if it was Tonya H's new baby. In waking life, Tonya H has only one child and he is perhaps 10-12 years old. I don't remember what Lilly H told me about the baby. I asked if Tonya H was around. She was but not somewhere that I could catch her or speak to her. As I turned around to leave I noticed Steve J. I hurried a bit to make sure I caught him. I said Hi, Steve J! With much enthusiasm. As I did this and got closer, I realized that it was not Steve J. The man asked me if he knew me. I said something trying to make it sound like he did but that I wasn't exactly sure how. I didn't want to admit that I had made a mistake. As I was talking, I leaned and looked at his nametag. It said Steve Galaad [unknown in waking life]. He was a construction worker or something because he had a hammer in his hand that he had raised in the air as we talked. I finally admitted that perhaps we didn't know each other and I must have mistaken him for someone else. I went back to find Margie D to see if she was ready to go. I found her and her two daughters sitting at a large round table eating. I asked what time I had left and they said 7:45 p.m. It was now 8:56 p.m. I said I've been gone an hour? I was surprised and very apologetic. As Margie D would have done in waking life she said it was no big deal and that, fortunately, she had remembered where to get food nearby. at a Chinese restaurant. They were all eating Chinese food. They offered me some but I declined. I apologized again. The table seemed to be in the linen department where the dream began.",department store margie linen section look slipcover comment think get one tell recently purchase sofa oversized chair also say fit exactly right low arm sofa pretty happy remember mention color recall see linen solid color deep color like navy forest green burgundy etc look notice two small girl come screen door say something someone store notice man speak leave ask daughter say yes comment cute walk away think attractive man remind ernie talk want get involve man look like ernie begin walk away noted prior familiar man since margie still look tell go another part store would back put question mark store environment seem confuse store office sure change know sure walk around saw tonya get chance speak keep walk saw old office sleep center take step back look notice take wall make one much large office look office notice make space office space five chair line row along table workspace close barely room move without touch three six people sit work two know one lilly ask like new space say somewhat sarcastically guess probably try sarcastic though know two people sit give guard answer reason realize suspicion right like new arrangement notice baby lie blanket floor back play even though baby caucasian ask lilly tonya new baby wake life tonya one child perhaps year old remember lilly tell baby ask tonya around somewhere could catch speak turn around leave notice steve hurried bit make sure catch say hi steve much enthusiasm get close realize steve man ask know say something try make sound like exactly sure want admit make mistake talk lean look nametag say steve galaad unknown wake life construction worker something hammer hand raise air talk finally admit perhaps know must mistake someone else go back find margie see ready go found two daughter sit large round table eat ask time leave say say go hour surprise apologetic margie would wake life say big deal fortunately remember get food nearby chinese restaurant eat chinese food offer decline apologize table seem linen department dream begin,13.678549,13.663535,832,2,12,3,3,10,2,8,13,9,20,2
1541,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,154,2001-01-06,"I was a student at a school and I had done something I shouldn't have. or was at least involved in it with someone else. At least part of it was graffiti. I don't remember what the graffiti was. We ran away but were caught. After being caught, someone else and I had the opportunity to run again. The person who did the graffiti told us to run without him. One part of this that is confusing is that the people I was running with changed several times. I don't know who it was initially. At one point, it was The Golden Girls and later it was girls I went to high school with, and another time it was only Brenda E. At the end, it was my family, Mother, Daddy, Brian F, Bev, and Bill F F. When I was running with Brenda E, I was getting very frustrated with her because she wasn't hiding or keeping up very well. There was a third person running with us. I don't know who. They were way behind. I thought they would catch up with us. We snuck around a red brick school. I was afraid someone would see as through the windows. I told Brenda E to keep down and come around the walls. There were several red brick walls. They were a wavy shape lengthwise. Then we snuck around another red brick building. We finally dodged inside a little dry cleaner/seamstress shop. There were three huge basket-like things hanging from the ceiling and moving back and forth on purpose and rhythmically. We each jumped up and clung to the end of one to keep from being seen by the employees. When we had a chance, we ducked into the next room. We were crouched on the floor behind a circular rack of clothes and fabric. Brenda E wasn't hiding well and I feared we would be seen. One thing in the rack was sheer brown piece of fabric. I could see the old woman through the fabric. I was afraid she would see us. I moved the rod in a circular motion very slightly trying to keep us hidden but she spotted us anyway. I lied and told her that we just needed to duck in from the cold. They took pity on us. Now I'm with my family but still in the same place. The young woman was doing makeovers on us to help keep us from being found. She made Kim H look like a movie star, as she requested. She asked me how I would like my hair done. I told her I like my style so she started spraying it seriously with hair spray. I felt like I was choking on the spray and told her to quit. I was thinking about what movie start I wanted to be made up as but didn't think of anyone so she didn't do anything else to me except to give me a bag of ice and told me to hold it on my face to reduce the puffiness. I held it on my eyes. My family and I are walking downtown Indy. I am watching the people very carefully to make sure none of them are the people who are after us. All I remember seeing is people in business suits carrying briefcases. It is now becoming nighttime and the streets are deserted. We see the horse-drawn carriage nearby sitting by Steak-N-Shake. It is empty but I tell the others that we must stay away from there or we are more likely to get caught. We are in a building looking at displays. They are Christmas displays mostly. One had many stuffed animals. I also saw a bed and pushed on the mattress and said how nice it would be to be in my own bed. Mari Kate S was with us now. We were purchasing things. I remember sweatshirts specifically. We were being careful to use cash so we wouldn't be leaving a trail. Brian F handed me some receipts and told me to make sure I used them. I started filling one out and realized I had written SVSDC, disclosing information on it. I tore it up, showed it to Brian F, threw it away and then paid cash for the sweatshirts. There were people there who were looking for us but they didn't give us away for some reason. The last room we went into had a lot of computers and electronics. I sat down at a desk to check my email. BJ said something about the amount of email. I then saw a Karaoke machine and asked Daddy to come record a song with me. He was a short, dark-haired, Italian man. Brian F joined us. I didn't want him there, but let him stay. We were going to sing We Wish You A Merry Christmas but we didn't know the version that was playing. Then a familiar version began playing so we started to sing. I was thinking that this was good, as I would be able to listen to and better decide if I am a good singer. The guy running the electronic place said he needed to close up. We said we would help because we are very familiar with the things there. We said Mother is very familiar with the type of typewriter so she could take care of it. I saw her sitting on the floor with the case, cleaning it, as part of closing up. I was looking under all the desks for money. Whenever I found change, I put it in my pocket. I found four quarters in a pile and under one desk.",student school something least involved someone else least part graffiti remember graffiti run away catch caught someone else opportunity run person graffiti tell u run without one part confuse people run change several time know initially one point golden girl later girl go high school another time brenda end family mother daddy brian bev bill run brenda get frustrate hiding keep well third person run u know way behind thought would catch u sneak around red brick school afraid someone would see window tell brenda keep come around wall several red brick wall wavy shape lengthwise snuck around another red brick building finally dodge inside little dry clean seamstress shop three huge basket like thing hang ceiling move back forth purpose rhythmically jump clung end one keep see employee chance duck next room crouch floor behind circular rack clothes fabric brenda hide well fear would see one thing rack sheer brown piece fabric could see old woman fabric afraid would see u move rod circular motion slightly try keep u hidden spot u anyway lie tell need duck cold take pity u family still place young woman makeover u help keep u find make kim look like movie star request ask would like hair tell like style start spray seriously hair spray felt like choke spray tell quit think movie start want make think anyone anything else except give bag ice tell hold face reduce puffiness hold eye family walk downtown indy watch people carefully make sure none people u remember see people business suit carry briefcase become nighttime street desert see horse draw carriage nearby sit steak shake empty tell others must stay away likely get catch build look display christmas display mostly one many stuffed animal also saw bed push mattress say nice would bed mari kate u purchase thing remember sweatshirt specifically careful use cash leave trail brian hand receipt tell make sure use start fill one realize write svsdc disclose information tore show brian throw away pay cash sweatshirt people look u give u away reason last room go lot computer electronics sit desk check email bj say something amount email saw karaoke machine ask daddy come record song short dark haired italian man brian join u want let stay go sing wish merry christmas know version playing familiar version begin play start sing think good would able listen good decide good singer guy run electronic place say need close say would help familiar thing say mother familiar type typewriter could take care saw sit floor case clean part close look desk money whenever find change put pocket find four quarter pile one desk,14.077252,13.445675,967,5,13,3,8,10,8,6,13,10,21,2

The place was a mess. I went back to the grill. There was as bun and a hamburger on the grill. not cooking but maybe being kept warm. There were also a bunch of candy wrappers in a section attached to the grill. like the drip pan. The one I remember was an M&M; wrapper. I told someone working there that you should always but two meat patties on a sandwich because it will taste much better and people will pay extra for it. I was making someone a fish sandwich so I put two pieces of fish on it. I went to look at the work schedule to see who was coming in that night. It said, Cutler. It was typed in bold black letters. He had been scheduled the previous night also. I thought it was good that he was scheduled because he's a good kid and good worker. For some reason I realized I would have to clean up the kitchen at close. That's a hard and messy job. When it was close to closing time, I took a metal piece off the ice cream syrup to wash it.

1544,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,157,2001-01-17,"Matthew left for school in the morning and I began working on Christmas presents. I think I was going to wrap some. I had told him to separate the ones for us from the ones for others. The ones for us were to be around the base and front of the tree. I found some for BJ's family, I think, around the front. They had been wrapped by the store in solid color shiny paper. They had little stickers on them that said what is inside. At first, I didn't like the stickers then I decided they were okay. There was a little more room under the tree than in waking life. Several of the packages were very tall and I thought I would lay them on their sides and slide them under the tree. Matthew cam back home. He had car trouble. I went with him in my car to do something about it. While driving/riding I realized we were sitting still in the road. I brought it to Matthew's attention. He looked and realized the car was not in gear. He put it in drive and started going again. He was very distraught about having car problems again. He was thinking about that instead of his driving. We started discussing his finances to see if he had the money to pay for more repairs. I asked him if he had anything in the bank and he said no. Then I asked how much he had in the bank and he said only about $3500. I was very surprised and said, really? He said yes, shaking his head yes at the same time. I suggested that it would be okay for him to buy another used car. We went to look for one. We went to a dealership. The owner walked by us and I told him I was referred to him. I said Matthew's paternal grandmother and his mother were good friends. He looked at us as if he didn't want to be bothered because he didn't know us but I guess he decided to he should because of his mother. Don H was there also. I said, Don H, I was going to call you because I need your help. I wanted him to help Matthew find and purchase a car. We were sitting at a table with the owner and he was hassling us as if he couldn't help. Finally, Darren handed him a check for $35 and said to put him in a car. I told him to make it $75 because I don't want him paying on this forever. He said he didn't think he could do anything because he doesn't sell blue cars, meaning inexpensive or lower end. I said that I was guessing his mother is a friend of Matthew's grandmother they must be somewhat alike. She would probably expect him to help us. He was visibly upset but obviously agreed with me. He told an employee to get the cash box. I could tell he wasn't getting ready to go show us some cars. After he walked away, I realized there were two rows of tables where employees were sitting, maybe having lunch. A black man sitting at one end was sitting there laughing about our conversation. He said the owner couldn't find anything for $75 a month, but knew he would sell us something for that amount because of his mother. I gave the man a playful slap on the arm and said, don't mess with my game here. He laughed harder and nodded his head yes.",matthew leave school morning begin work christmas present think go wrap tell separate one u one others one u around base front tree find bj family think around front wrap store solid color shiny paper little sticker say inside first like sticker decide okay little room tree wake life several package tall thought would lay side slide tree matthew cam back home car trouble go car something drive rid realize sit still road bring matthew attention look realized car gear put drive start go distraught car problem think instead drive start discus finance see money pay repair ask anything bank say ask much bank say surprise say really say yes shake head yes time suggest would okay buy another used car go look one go dealership owner walk u tell refer say matthew paternal grandmother mother good friend look u want bother know u guess decide mother also say go call need help want help matthew find purchase car sit table owner hassle u help finally darren hand check say put car tell make want pay forever say think could anything sell blue car mean inexpensive low end say guess mother friend matthew grandmother must somewhat alike would probably expect help u visibly upset obviously agree tell employee get cash box could tell get ready go show u car walk away realize two row table employee sit maybe lunch black man sit one end sit laugh conversation say owner find anything month know would sell u something amount mother give man playful slap arm say mess game laugh hard nodded head yes,13.58818,13.621169,612,6,12,3,2,11,6,9,17,8,21,2

1550,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,163,2001-02-06,"I was riding this thing I called a bike but it was actually shaped more like a go-cart. It was a metal frame like a bike with just a seat and an awning over head. I was headed to this restaurant, maybe Denny's. As I neared the restaurant, it started to rain slightly. I thought how fortunate I was that I was almost there. When I got to the restaurant, I couldn't find a place to park. I thought it was just as well because I was afraid the bike might be stolen. I folded it up, much as you would fold a luggage carrier and took it inside. When I got inside, I was looking for a place to stand it and a place for me to sit. I struggled a bit, moving it around because it was so big. I finally leaned it against the wall near the coat rack. There were two overcoats hung on peg hooks on the wall so the bike was on top of them. Until this point, I was not thinking about why I was going there or that I was meeting someone else. I entered the restaurant looking for a place to sit alone. After I got in there I saw the women that I was meeting there and went to sit with them. While we were eating, several men came up to us. The other women knew them because they work with them. After a brief conversation, one of the men showed us a video. The video was of a large room with probably hundreds of men in it. I recall one young man in particular. It was his first time in that place and he seemed unsure about himself. The man who took him there was showing him around as if training him for a new job. I have some sense that the men in the video were mobsters. Suddenly, a group of men with machine guns came in and started killing everyone. I watched the video as it scanned the room. Men were falling everywhere as they were gunned down. I kept wondering why no one told this one young man to fall to the ground to try to protect himself. The video had a strong impact on me. I still have a very vivid image of one of the men. He was probably in his 50s, with silver gray hair and medium build. I'm not sure why, but I didn't think much of him that maybe he was somewhat sleazy. Just after the movie, ended one of the women sat down next to me and sat on this man's hand. It was as though she was straddling his arm. She had on a short skirt and white hose. He pulled it out from under here from the front. My first impression was that he did it on purpose and I didn't like that. Then I decided not to assume that. I should consider it an accident. However, after that, he was laying on his back on the floor laughing and she straddled him and was acting, playfully, as if she was going to hit him or something for doing it. Then they both got off the floor. Something started to happen at the restaurant. One of the women I was with also worked there. She came from behind the counter and physically stopped the disturbance. I recall seeing her do a karate kick. I realized now the men and women I met in this restaurant, and myself, were police officers. I had come to this place to take a new job. We all got up to head to the police station. They were laughing about my bike. They said something about the rain and I pointed out that the bike had an awning. They led the way to the town and police station with me following on my bike. As we entered the town, I was simply in awe. It almost looked like something out of a Disney village though not really that either. All of the buildings were very colorful and playful. For example, one was white with red storybook lettering. It is very hard to describe. Every building had many compartments on the outside with a separate item in each compartment things like stuffed animals. I loved it. I was trying to take it all in while following them. They stopped at the police station and I missed it. I got frustrated because I had gone down a hill and now I had to peddle back up the hill. The police station and fire station were attached. You didn't realize the police station was there until you went inside. I got off my bike and a man and a young boy came out to help me with my things. I had several duffel bags attached to my bike that I didn't have before. I took two of them off and handed them to the man. After I had folded the bike up again I gave it and one bag to the young boy. He was in awe of my bike. I kept one bag myself. When I went inside, I was in a very narrow, but short, hallway. Part of the way down the hallway I had to take a step down to continue. At the end of the hallway were several rooms. One was an open room. Several women were sitting around a table. I don't know what they were doing. Behind them was an office door. I went in there to meet the man in charge. He was looking for my first day paperwork and couldn't find it. His wife came in to help. He got on the phone and called someone about it. He was frustrated and telling his wife how it would delay my paychecks if it didn't get done on my first day. She was sympathetic but told him she really needed to get started on the next lunch though I knew she meant the dinner meal, or it would be late.

I mentioned the movie Stigmata and he said he would like to see it so I put it in for us to watch together. We had kissed 2-3 times. They were very brief, gentle kisses. I thought how nice it was to be with such a gentleman, and someone that I had things in common with. He was laying on the sofa watching the movie and I was sitting behind the back of the sofa taking some bottles of drinks out of their original packages and putting them in a larger box with compartments. Some were beer and some were pink wine coolers. It was the kind of box that wine and liquor bottles come in but there were many more compartments. The bottles were different sizes. Some were very small like those you get on an airplane. One was larger than all the rest. I put more than one bottle in some of the compartments. I don't know why I was doing this. When I was almost done, I realized I was making a lot of noise. About that time, I heard something from my date. I leaned over the back of the sofa and asked what was wrong. He was about to turn the movie off because I was making so much noise with the bottles. I kissed him lightly and told him I was done.

1554,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,167,2001-02-15,"I went to a high school to give a talk. There were TV media there. I was on the gym floor sitting on a bench in the middle of the floor. The students were all on one side in the bleachers. They were very poorly behaved. I said something to the media person with a microphone. It was not until this time that I realized they were students. When I arrived at the school, the driveway and parking were very odd. It was as if I was driving down steps and then had to park on one side angled toward the direction I had come in. When I got ready to leave, I was told I had to leave in the direction I was headed when I came in. This was very awkward because of the direction of the parking I also did not know my way going that way. They told me to go the end, take a left, and then right. That I couldn't get lost. When I turned right, I was in something resembling a very narrow alley, one car width wide. I don't recall seeing building but there was a chain link fence and a lot of gates. Every few hundred feet I had to stop and open a gate. It also kept making turns. I was getting frustrated, upset, and angry. I left my car, threw some kind of very large square board to the side, and continued on foot. I came to a bunch of houses and was walking through their yards trying to figure out where the road to the highway was. I finally asked for directions at one house. A man and woman gave me directions but then she suggested that he take me back to my car and then lead me where I needed to go. He did. As we approached my car, he sympathized with me and told me they shouldn't have done that.

They had me standing on one of the dining tables to take my picture. The tables formed a T and I was standing in the cross section facing the top of the T. At another point, Bruce W was kneeling on the longer table facing the same direction to have his picture taken. Somebody was joking around with him. Later I was looking at the pictures and saw that another of my cousin's, Linda W, was standing on the table behind me when they took my picture. She was a bridesmaid and she was dressed in green. Somebody said she was supposed to be there in that picture. The wedding was at Bev's house. It didn't look like her actual house. Nicholas F came running out with this little green umbrella. It was just big enough around to protect him and it was deep with a very short handle. I thought it was so cute and I played with him and the umbrella for a little bit. I was using the bathroom and Nicholas F was standing to my right. I didn't seem to mind that he was there. I realized that I had no pulled the door shut so I reached up and shut it. At that point, Brian F and Mari Kate S came in. I got upset and said can't a person use the bathroom without being disturbed. Mari Kate S let Brian F climb on her back and she carried him out. I got upset because when he climbed on her back he could see over the stall door. It is now near the end of the reception. I am very tired and want to go home. I put on a pair of white socks and my tennis shoes. Bev and I were sitting next to each other leaned against each other waiting to go. We had fallen asleep like that. John S came to awaken us. I asked if it was time to go and he said yes. This is odd because earlier the wedding was at Bev's house but now we are going home to Bev's house. When we get there, I see John set a brown coffee mug down and I asked him if he had trouble staying awake getting home. He said just a little. We went upstairs and I noticed Rachel S's bed. I didn't want to admit that I had not realized that she had not been at the wedding with us. I said that it's a shame Rachel S couldn't be at the wedding. Where has she been? She had been staying with John's parents. Matthew came up to me. He was only about 9 or 10 years old. I hugged him and rested my chin on his head. I asked him if he had a good time.

There were other police officers there as well. Suzanne B was there also, as a police officer. We were all in checkout lines. There was a criminal of some sort loose in the store. I was the first to spot him coming towards us from the right rear. I yelled, there he is and pointed to him. I was talking mostly to Suzanne B because I thought she had a clear shot of him. He was wearing a tan suit, white shirt and a tie. He was a tall man with brown, balding hair and mustache. After I shouted to Suzanne B, everyone dropped to the floor and I tried to crawl under the register counter. I had just gotten under it when the gunman appeared on the floor right next to me. He handed me his gun and told me to keep it on the crowd. As soon as I had the chance, I began taking shots at the criminal. I took a couple of shots and didn't kill him. I then got very scared. As soon as he turned his back, I shot him a couple more times until I was sure he was dead. It felt awful. I was really shaken up by it. Suzanne B and I were at the police department I think yet it also seemed that we were still somehow at the store. We were at our lockers getting changed and talking about what happened. As we were walking out, I was trying to apply lipstick and tried three times before I actually got it to stay on. We ran into the police chief. He wanted to talk to me primarily about the shooting, at least partially to make sure I was okay. I was dressed in a nice dress and high heels and had fixed my hair.

I was hesitant but, as in the past, had a hard time telling him no. When I got to the room another woman came in also and another man. I noticed a large round pendant around Wes S's neck. It was clear with something red inside of it. I left because I was uncomfortable with the sexual atmosphere in the room. After I left, the room transformed into two large meeting rooms. Many of the employees of the hotel were going in and joining in the activities. The activities remind me of the movie Eyes Wide Shut. As I was walking through the hotel, I overheard members of management getting upset because so many employees were missing. They were going to fire all of them. I decided to just leave. I went to the parking garage to find my car. All of the cars but mine were very expensive cars and limos. Mine looked like an oversized chair. I folded it down and it became a car. As I getting ready to get into my car, I saw Wes S's pendant lying on the ground. I knew it was important to him so I decided to go find him and return it to him. I was walking outside on a second or third floor with an atrium in the middle. I thought I heard Wes S down below. I looked over the rail and he was there. I told him I had his pendant. When I met him to give his pendant back, he apologized profusely for what happened in the room.

1560,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,173,2001-02-26,"I was staying at a hotel with people I knew. We were there for some kind of professional conference. I went into an area that looked like a big warehouse. Vendors were sitting around with boxes of their things to set up in booths. One of the vendors was CFC. I was sitting at a table with Lilly H. She told one of the reps that they know if they want our business that they have to bring two of any gifts to her and her co-worker. I said no, they have to bring three, meaning they have to bring one for me also. I went down some steps to go outside. There was a busy street, several lanes wide. I crossed the street to go somewhere. I realized I only had socks on but decided to go ahead. When I came out to go back to the hotel it was raining really hard. I took my socks off and ran barefoot across the street. After I crossed the street, I noticed a place that I could walk under and not get wet as long as I stayed right in the middle. The further I went though the lower the top got. I finally got to a place where I either, had to get on my hands and knees and crawl through this drainage pipe or I had to squeeze through this other opening to my left side. This part is especially odd because the opening couldn't have been more than 12-inch square. I was somewhat concerned that I would get stuck going through there. I thought about my option of the drainage pipe and decided to take my chances with the other opening. It was tight and I got a little nervous after I was halfway through but I got through. The best way I can describe how I got through is what you might see if a cartoonist drew it. When I got back to the hotel, I was having a conversation with my boyfriend. We went and sat down by another woman that he was also dating. I got really upset with her, got in her face, pointed my finger, and told her this conversation does not concern her. I really thought some ugly things about her. I said that I needed to get out of here. I got up and walked away. I knew if I didn't I would say something mean to her and I didn't want to do that. I went outside. The rain had stopped. My boyfriend came after me. He wanted to fix things. I told him I wasn't going to do this anymore. I did not want to hurt his other girlfriend so I was not going to see him anymore. I told him I would fly home the next morning, as I couldn't afford my own hotel room. He did not want to lose me. He begged me to stay and said he would end it with her. I said that wasn't fair to her. I really didn't want to hurt her. I also wanted to respect myself so I would leave. I told him how very much I loved him and how incredibly difficult this would be for me but that in the long run I knew it would be better for all three of us. He said if he was going to lose one of us it would not be me. I finally agreed to stay and let him break it off with her. He got another hotel room. He told me to get just a few things out of our joint room for now. All three of us were in the same room. He said he would get the rest of our things out and bring them to our new room after he had talked with her. I expected it to take awhile but it didn't. He came to the room and said it was time to celebrate. Just at that moment, there was a knock on the door. It was room service with champagne, strawberries and whipped cream, candles, and bubble bath. He said we would take a bubble bath, make love, and then have a wonderful dinner brought to the room. Somehow, I knew that during dinner he was going to ask me to marry him.",stay hotel people know kind professional conference go area look like big warehouse vendor sit around box thing set booth one vendor cfc sit table lilly tell one rep know want business bring two gift co worker say bring three mean bring one also go step go outside busy street several lane wide cross street go somewhere realize sock decide go ahead come go back hotel rain really hard take sock run barefoot across street cross street noticed place could walk get wet long stay right middle go though low top get finally get place either get hand knee crawl drainage pipe squeeze opening leave side part especially odd open inch square somewhat concern would get stick go thought option drainage pipe decide take chance open tight get little nervous halfway get best way describe get might see cartoonist drew get back hotel conversation boyfriend go sat another woman also date get really upset get face point finger tell conversation concern really think ugly thing say need get get walk away knew would say something mean want go outside rain stop boyfriend come want fix thing tell go anymore want hurt girlfriend go see anymore tell would fly home next morning afford hotel room want lose beg stay say would end say fair really want hurt also want respect would leave tell much love incredibly difficult would long run knew would better three u say go lose one u would finally agree stay let break get another hotel room tell get thing joint room three u room say would get rest thing bring new room talk expect take awhile come room say time celebrate moment knock door room service champagne strawberry whip cream candle bubble bath say would take bubble bath make love wonderful dinner bring room somehow know dinner go ask marry,13.785626,13.534824,731,3,10,4,6,7,6,7,8,10,17,2

I told him I would now need to know what his name really is. He said it is R Williams. We were living in a house in the country. It was very small with maybe 4-5 rooms but I only remember two of the rooms. There were curtains in the doorway between the two rooms. The one small room was divided by a partial wall. I used it for storage. I had to bend over to go through the doorway into that space. There was a window in that space. Before moving into the house, we talked about the fact that we would need to add plumbing. We were talking about the kitchen. There were several people. Kim H, Jody S, Matthew, some other young man, and a young woman who was kind of our housekeeper. Three groups of really rough looking men came into the house without knocking on several occasions. After the last group did this, Nick R left the house with a shovel and something else and I was afraid of what he might be planning to do. He was very angry. He killed and buried several of the men after swearing to me he was done with the Mafia and their ways. He came back dressed kind of like an Indian. He said he put them all in the ground. I was so disappointed in him. Something else happened and we were saying that we needed to go after someone. No one else would so I got on a horse bareback, even though I didn't know how to ride. I had a lot of trouble getting on the horse. I finally did and then chased after that person or those people.

My younger son, not Matthew, was using a spoon and digging into the middle of lots of them to try each one without choosing one and finishing it. I scolded him and told him not to do that. Three of the ice creams were flat and round, like tostados. One was pink. One was blue. There was third as well. They had sprinkles or something like that on them also. Some of them were bars that stood on their side and had two sticks in them. There was a man and a woman to the right behind Matthew. I don't remember what they were doing there. As we finished the ice cream, I started cleaning up and there was a large, African American woman sitting on a table to my left. She had her back to me and was on the phone. She was wearing cultural clothing. I realized that she was about to sit in some ice cream so I nudged her to sit up a bit so I could wipe it up before she sat in it.

I don't remember the wedding itself. I don't even know who was getting married. After the wedding was over, we opened the door to let the other guests in. there wasn't really room for them because there were dining tables set up that took up the whole room.

We had some chairs set up around the perimeter of the room I was trying to make as much room as I could and have seats for people. There was bunch of junk in the room.

I don't know why but it seems that Alan K was there because I don't remember seeing him or anything. I just have this sense that he was in it. It also seems like there were two separate wedding dreams. At another one, the room setting was very similar but I went in and Uncle H and Aunt R were sitting there eating. There was a woman and an empty seat between them. I thought that maybe she could move over one so there would be two seats together but I don't think I actually said this.

I stepped into this area where I was going to be wrapped up like a postal package. We could decide what kind of wrapping we wanted. I decided plain brown wrapper with white string. When I stepped into the spot, Tom Hanks appeared and did the wrapping. He was having a lot of fun doing it. I was so excited. He was really, really nice to me. It was as if it was some kind of game. Later I was with just a few friends and there was one or two children. I thought it was odd that we were dressed in swimsuits and robes but they said that was the typical dress for where we were going, to just put a robe over your swimsuit. Then I saw we were going to a swimming pool. At the pool, there was a large group of men sitting all around in their street clothes. I realized this was another joke. They had arranged for all these men to be there. They said they wanted to see me in a swimsuit. I let my robe fall open a bit and pretended not to notice as I continued to talk to my friends. I finally took my robe off, got into the pool, and swam the width of the pool. After I got to the other side, I got out and saw all the men were gone. They said they were only there to see me in a swimsuit so as soon as they did they all got up and left. One of my women friends was surprised that I didn't look half-bad in a swimsuit. I felt pretty confident but also recognized the areas where it was obvious that I need to lose weight. I went to get back in the pool and there was this thing, reminds me of a mattress cover, covering the entire area of the pool. I lay down on top of it. It was very relaxing. I was back in my room. I'm confused as to whether it was a hotel. I think not. I was with my CRHP sisters again. We were putting some things away. There were Christmas decorations and Halloween costumes. I was dividing them into piles because they each needed to go to different rooms. I took the Christmas stuff to two different places. Then I took the Halloween stuff to another place. BJ was on a ladder and I handed her the costumes on hangers. She wasn't sure what to do with them and then turned around and saw others hanging above and behind her. She asked if I was sure that this is where they were supposed to go. I said yes. I was thinking that this is where they are kept for storage until it is time to get them out. I was at NTNS. Someone else and I are carrying these things into an attic, kind of like the one in my birth home. I think Bob F was one of the ones helping. I was separating things into piles by the boxes they would go in. Several of us were in the attic and I pointed out that we needed to start digging out the boxes. Nobody really wanted to because it was going to be a big hassle. I can still picture it in my mind but I don't know how to describe it. I leave and am back at my home/apartment/hotel. We are supposed to be getting ready to go to a play. I realize that I am the last one to get ready and the others are trying to be patient in waiting for me. I am rushing around trying to get ready as quickly as possible. I end up having to change a thing or two. Suzanne B is worried that we are going to be late but I can see she is trying very hard to be patient. I put on my black satin suit and decided to wear flats instead of heels since we were in a hurry. They were quicker to grab and I could walk faster. When we were headed out, we went through this area that looked like a building under construction again. Tom Hanks was there again and pretended that he was going to wrap me up again. This time he said he was just playing around and was just there to walk me to the car and say good-bye. I asked if I could give him a hug and kiss. I intended to just kiss him on the cheek. He leaned over and gave me a very light, quick kiss on the lips and a big hug. I felt like I had died and gone to heaven. I was so excited. He walked me to the car. When we got to the play, I was suddenly with Mother and Daddy. I told Daddy to go and ahead and Mother and I would catch up. It seemed like we were someplace like Las Vegas. Once inside I was back with my CRHP sisters. We were standing around talking. I was telling them about Tom Hanks. Several of them told me that Sheila G had arranged all of that for me specifically. I walked through the crowd of them to Sheila G. Sheila G appeared to me as Tracy P, but I knew it was Sheila G. I thought, oh yeah, she has a job where she has contact with or access to these stars. I thanked her profusely for what she had arranged with Tom. I was very excited. There was another part, but I'm not sure where it fits in here. Someone had arranged for a seal, an actual animal, to come to my room as a date. I was very upset and was trying to hold the door so it couldn't get in. It was trying to squeeze in under the door. I was trying to hold the bottom of the door with one hand while grabbing things to block the door and the seal with another. I grabbed a few items and was finally able to block the door and get enough weight against it so the seal couldn't get in. The seal left but then came back later and tried again. I did the same thing but this time I eventually got enough things in front of the door that I could move away long enough to move furniture in front of the door as well. I needed that to keep the seal out that time, as he seemed more determined than ever to get. The furniture successfully kept him out.",crhp sister detail sketchy step area go wrap like postal package could decide kind wrap want decide plain brown wrapper white string step spot tom hank appear wrap lot fun excite really really nice kind game later friends one two child think odd dress swimsuit robe say typical dress go put robe swimsuit saw go swim pool pool large group men sit around street clothes realize another joke arrange men say want see swimsuit let robe fall open bit pretended notice continue talk friend finally take robe get pool swam width pool get side get saw men go say see swimsuit soon get leave one woman friends surprised look half bad swimsuit felt pretty confident also recognize area obvious need lose weight go get back pool thing remind mattress cover cover entire area pool lay top relaxing back room confuse whether hotel think crhp sister put thing away christmas decoration halloween costume divide pile need go different room take christmas stuff two different place take halloween stuff another place bj ladder hand costume hanger sure turn around saw others hang behind asked sure suppose go say yes think keep storage time get ntns someone else carry thing attic kind like one birth home think bob one one help separate thing pile box would go several u attic point need start dig box nobody really want go big hassle still picture mind know describe leave back home apartment hotel suppose get ready go play realize last one get ready others try patient wait rush around try get ready quickly possible end change thing two suzanne worry go late see try hard patient put black satin suit decide wear flat instead heel since hurry quicker grab could walk faster head go area look like build construction tom hank pretend go wrap time say play around walk car say good bye ask could give hug kiss intend kiss cheek lean give light quick kiss lip big hug felt like die go heaven excite walked car get play suddenly mother daddy tell daddy go ahead mother would catch seem like someplace like la vega inside back crhp sister stand around talk tell tom hank several tell sheila arrange specifically walk crowd sheila sheila appear tracy know sheila think oh yeah job contact access star thank profusely arrange tom excite another part sure fit someone arrange seal actual animal come room date upset try hold door get try squeeze door try hold bottom door one hand grab thing block door seal another grabbed item finally able block door get enough weight seal get seal leave come back later tried thing time eventually get enough thing front door could move away long enough move furniture front door well need keep seal time seem determine ever get furniture successfully keep,14.047233,13.841441,1130,6,20,6,6,13,12,10,16,19,28,2

I went out to go to a nearby store to get something related to the computer but I don't remember what. It was raining.

When I got to the store, I was looking for I went to the counter and was discussing my needs with a young man there. An older man came out. I realized it was Mike M. I didn't acknowledge that it was him, nor did he acknowledge that it was I. He came up to the counter and joined in the discussion. I realized that my clothes were lying around and I quickly grabbed them up, embarrassed for him to see that, especially since my bra was lying there to. I embarrassingly said, Sorry, I was changing my clothes while I was working. I'm sure he knew it was me because he has seen a picture of me. I haven't seen a picture of him so I don't know how I knew it was him.

1571,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,184,2001-03-12,"I was at WDF. There was a section of the plant that was like a doctor's office or hospital. The nurses were taking my blood pressure but they didn't know which number was systolic and which was diastolic. I tried to tell them that the 118 was the upper number as that was pretty normal for me. They didn't believe me. They took it twice. They were worried that it was much too high so they were going to have someone else take it again. This person pumped the sleeve up and then walked away to do something else without reading it. She thought she would be back in time to read it. She did this twice. She apologized for getting distracted and told me to take a break and come back. I went to find a bathroom. They told me where I had to go out into the plant. I did. There were two Port-o-Lets out there. One for men and one for women. There were men working around there and I was afraid that the ones working up high would be able to see down in through the top. I realized that the top was covered with something dome shaped. I went in. One of the sidewalls had an opening down to my waist. I decided they couldn't see too much from that angle so I was going to go ahead and use it. Then I realized that there was no toilet in it so I went back out. I got some lunch but I don't remember how, where or what. I was sitting on the floor with some other people watching an interview. I realized that it was Kendall B that they were interviewing. I was so excited. I was eager to hear his voice again and to hear what he had to say. As I was sitting there, Vince P came up behind Kendall B and motioned to me. I was also excited to see him so I went out to talk to him. He said he decided to come there because I had tried to get in touch with him. I asked how he, Sue P and his family were. I actually asked twice but he didn't answer me. He looked great, as always, but was wearing his hair in a different style. We were suddenly outside in a neighborhood. 2-3 other cars were driving crazy and almost hit his car. We were walking and I was looking through the trees for his car. I wanted to see what he was driving. I don't think I ever saw it. He started telling me about this girl he had seen a few times but decided not to see her again. I was reading his description of his experience with her. He was describing their experience making love, though his description was cryptic rather than using the exact terms. He decided not to see her again because she enjoyed sex too much. This seemed odd to me since I was often put off by his sexual interests. In this thing I was reading, she said she would try to be more quiet. I don't know how to explain the paper I was reading. I was using my hands to pull it out a little at a time as I read it. Kind of like I was unrolling and rolling it as I read. The letters were very large and various bold colors. There were also flowers on it. I went back inside for them to take my blood pressure again. There was a head nurse who had just started working there. She had been taking inventory of supplies, cleaning up, and organizing. I looked out a window and saw her mowing the grass and some really tall weeds and such. My first thought was how much I enjoy mowing grass. Then I noticed that she had a really heavy-duty mower. It was mowing down tree trunks that were approximately 1 inch in diameter. I wished I had a mower like that. Then I thought it was sad that she was cutting down the tall stuff and destroying the natural environment like that. I climbed up and sat on a cabinet. It had a warped wood surface. I wondered if it would hold me or what they would say, so I only sat on it partially. I decided to ring the nurse call button. I was surprised at how loud it was. Someone came and looked at the call screen to see who rang them, then looked at me. It was Rosemary P. I told her what had been going on and that I was still waiting. I saw Gale W in the background.

The line was so long that I didn't think she would get to it before the store closed so I decided not to leave it with her. I thought I should probably take it to a jewelry store anyway.

I was looking for a small TV for my office that I could also move around easily and that would not be very expensive. The aisles were very narrow. I had to squeeze through some of them. The store was packed with products and people. I was looking around and finally spotted the TV section. There were microwaves mixed in with the TV's. I accidentally opened a microwave and shut it right away, hoping no one had noticed. I was afraid they would realize that I had mistaken the microwave for a TV. I was looking for a TV around $200.

After the incident with Al H I thought about calling Deb U and asking her to say something to him about how inappropriate it was for him to ask me to run copies.

I was standing at a magazine rack going through loose pages of the yellow pages looking for information about exercise equipment. Twice clerks came up to me and pointed out there exercise equipment but I told them I was looking for something very specific. I think I was looking for something like the ab roller that I use at the Y. I started to walk away and I walked by this counter. There was a man and two women there. The two women were making a strawberry milkshake. I saw one put a scoop of vanilla ice cream into the blender. I said, Now that's what I'm looking for. They said, do you really want it? I said sure. But I had to find a glass to put it in. I told them to hold on a second, that I would go get my other one. I went to get it but it had chocolate all over the inside. I went to grab something else, it was a blender beaker as well, but it had chocolate in it too. I told them I would just go to the refreshment counter and get a cup from them. They said, You're going to buy one for that? I said I would if they wouldn't just give me one. The next thing I know, though, I am standing at the refreshment counter with the shake in an actual glass. I pick up a lid, though it doesn't snap onto the glass and I stick a straw through the lid and I leave. As I was leaving the store I noticed a penny on the cement. I was happy as I always am to find a penny and said the Our Father as I always do when I find a penny. But as I bent over to pick it up I saw another one. When I reached for it I realized there was a lot of change on the sidewalk right there. So I started picking it all up and putting in the pockets of my jacket. My jacket was white knit so the change in the pockets pulled it down a lot in front. Some of the change was in piles and had 50 cent pieces and silver dollars and quarters in it.

So I went back to where my unit was and I had one of them come with me. Actually, several of them came with me. They went in and found a couple of lights and turned them on and got the lights working so I could turn them on from the switches. The one farthest from me was missing so they rigged it so it would always be on. It was a small light that would be on all the time. The other room was kind of like three sections and one section was all the men. The next section was two women; one might have been an officer whose rank was between mine and the rest of the unit. The last section was two more women in separate beds. When we got the lights working in my room I came back into their room and I grabbed two pillows from that last bed and took them into my room. The men that I took with me had been drinking. I decided to go for a drive and get something to eat. When I did I saw one of the members of my unit out there. I sat and watched and saw his pregnant wife there too. He was beating her and she lashed back, apparently had just taken self-defense lessons so he wouldn't be able to do this to her anymore.

It was the strip mall where SFI was but it was completely redone so that I hardly recognized it. All the stores were on the same level as the parking rather than having to go up steps to get to them. The outdoor mall in front of T.J. Maxx was now filled in. The outside was mostly white with bright pretty colors for accents and signs. I pointed out SFI and told BJ that is where I used to work but commented on how different it looked and also pointed out some of the differences. We went inside. I couldn't believe how different it looked. It was a long, narrow store. With new pretty fixtures. There was very little merchandise. I don't even remember seeing any clothing.

1579,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,192,2001-03-17,"This dream was about the research group, about the meeting coming up tomorrow night. Pam Ta arrived early and added her pieces to the group collage. Her and Sophia K put their things on the floor and started working on their individual collages. I wasn't really paying attention. I heard them talking, but I wasn't really paying attention. Pretty soon I noticed that Pam Ta had almost finished hers and at that point I said something. She said she needed to leave early so that's why she went ahead and did hers. I then looked at Sophia K and she had done her individual collage on the group collage. She went ahead and did hers also but she also did it on the group collage. I was frustrated with this because they started without the rest of the group and because once again Sophia K had not followed instructions. Of course, Sophia K reasoned that it wasn't going to matter, there was absolutely nothing wrong with what she had done. With Pam Ta I felt a little better about it because I knew she had to leave early. I started taking pictures and when the rest of the group got here they started discussing Pam Ta's. I said, Now, wait a minute. Can we discuss this without it affecting our own at all. Of course, they all thought that we could.

1580,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,193,2001-03-17,"My extended family and I had gone to something like a carnival with a picnic lunch. Carnival is the closest I can come to describing it though it was indoors. All of my siblings and their children and my parents were there. When we got there, Jonathan F and I took off. We spent the day with some mobsters and some Indians. We had a really good time. The mobsters were all very nice. We sat and played checkers with them and talked with them. The Indians taught us things. They taught us to make some little tools. One was a tool to fish with. They showed us how to fish with it. When we got back to the rest of the family they had all eaten already and were almost ready to go home. Jonathan and I walked away again to get something to drink. We found some cups but we had to try several soft drink machines before we found one that worked. Then we went back to the family and started helping them load up the vehicles. Bob F had his van and the rest of us rode in the back of an open-bed truck. There was a tray that had deviled eggs and raspberry tarts on it. The tarts looked like round biscuits, cut open and stuffed with raspberry pie filling. Someone commented on how good the tarts were but that we forgot to eat them. When we were loading up they all got eaten but one. I took half of that one and someone else took the other. But when I took it, it was more like toast with raspberry pie filling on it and some little round or square things on top. It wasn't nearly as good as the others looked. I took the tray of deviled eggs out and when I got out there I realized that there was another tray of eggs too and that I should have combined them. I also realized I should have covered them with plastic wrap before I brought them out. I asked someone to hold them so I could go in and get some plastic wrap but they didn't. I thought about trying to balance them on the truck while I was wrapping them. Then I thought I should just take them back inside and wrap them but I don't remember doing that. There were also all of these trays of cookies. Everybody got everything loaded up and in the truck except me. I was going to sit in the same place that I sat going there. I had to pull out this thing and there was a plastic container for me to sit in. But someone had filled it with cookies for Bev to take to her in-laws. So, we had to take all of the cookies out. BJ said she needed to go buy tickets to a Reds game. Daddy backed the truck up to the lines where she was buying the tickets. But he almost hit some people. I was yelling at him to stop and he just barely stopped in time without hitting anyone. BJ came back out and said that there were no tickets left for the entire season. One of her kids, I think Todd A, was very upset at this. Todd A was a lot younger than in waking life. Somebody said one of the reasons they were all sold out was because of a Cobb wedding. The Cobb's had purchased every seat in the stadium. Bev said to us that it sounded like the Cobb's. Somebody else said they had some tickets to sell. They started out saying they had some $12 seats and asked if anyone was interested in those. Nobody was. Then they said they had some $15 dollar seats. Then, somebody said here's two seats for $250 each. Somebody bought those. It turned out they were Kim H's tickets that she sold. She was really excited about this. We went ahead and started leaving. Daddy was backing up the truck, but it seemed more like he was just letting it roll and not paying attention to where it was rolling or not aware that it was rolling. I yelled at him again to stop because he was about to back into things. He was about to back into a soda machine. Then he almost hit some gas tanks, and then a couple of other things. He finally stopped the truck and said, I don't know what you were yelling about. I said, because you just missed hitting all of this stuff. Daddy started driving and I was actually walking along the truck. When he came to a stoplight I leaned my back and hands against a wall to try to get into the box. Bob F and Bill F helped get my legs in. Then I pulled on Bill F to get myself in the rest of the way. Once I was in we had to put all of these cookies back in around me. Bev was telling me which ones to put where and how to put them in because there were several different kinds.",extend family go something like carnival picnic lunch carnival close come describe though indoors sibling child parent get jonathan take spent day mobster indian really good time mobster nice sit play checker talk indian teach u thing teach u make little tool one tool fish show u fish get back rest family eat already almost ready go home jonathan walk away get something drink find cup try several soft drink machine find one work go back family start help load vehicle bob van rest u ride back open bed truck tray devil egg raspberry tart tart look like round biscuit cut open stuffed raspberry pie fill someone comment good tart forget eat load get eaten one take half one someone else take take like toast raspberry pie fill little round square thing top nearly good others look take tray devil egg get realize another tray egg combine also realize cover plastic wrap bring ask someone hold could go get plastic wrap think try balance truck wrap think take back inside wrap remember also trays cooky everybody get everything load truck except go sit place sit go pull thing plastic container sit someone fill cooky bev take law take cooky bj say need go buy ticket red game daddy back truck line buy ticket almost hit people yell stop barely stop time without hit anyone bj come back say ticket leave entire season one kid think todd upset todd lot young wake life somebody say one reason sell cobb wed cobb purchase every seat stadium bev say u sound like cobb somebody else say ticket sell start say seat ask anyone interested nobody say dollar seat somebody say two seat somebody buy turned kim ticket sell really excite go ahead start leave daddy back truck seem like let roll pay attention roll aware roll yell stop back thing back soda machine almost hit gas tank couple thing finally stop truck say know yell say miss hit stuff daddy start drive actually walk along truck come stoplight lean back hand wall try get box bob bill help get legs pull bill get rest way put cooky back around bev tell one put put several different kind,13.891347,13.736079,871,2,8,2,1,6,2,4,9,3,15,2
1581,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,194,2001-03-18,"The SVSDC was being expanded. They had remodeled all of the storage cabinets in the sleep area. They looked like kitchen cabinets. All of the doors were etched glass with white knobs. The cabinets were white. It was cool the way they were expanding the building. They had a forklift and they just lifted one of the walls and moved it out further. When I was walking around, there were quite a few patients standing around and two of them were in bed. One was Brandy C. I asked someone if she was having another sleep study. I was standing at this sink cleaning out something that was shaped like a lint roller but it was metal and had holes and things sticking out of it. It had some really goopy stuff in it and I was standing there gagging as I was cleaning it. Anne Marie [unknown in waking life] was standing on the other side of the sink facing me and told me that it's just mucus. There was also this other woman standing to my right. It was a woman from ER. The one that sponsors Carter but I can't remember her name. She was more sympathetic. I wouldn't even say what it was that I was cleaning out. Then I had this piece of meat, maybe a steak, while I was standing there at the sink. I wanted to lay it down and wanted someone to grab a plate for me. Instead this other woman laid a huge piece of raw salmon on the counter and I laid the steak on top of it. I had put a bunch of Rolodex cards into a Rolodex and it was overflowing. They didn't want to buy another one so I went to the sleep area to see if I could find another one in storage. While I was back there, I started talking to Susan J. We were both complaining about things they had done back there. They didn't want us to spend money on office supplies but yet they had all the cabinet doors replaced with this expensive engraved glass. I also noted that all of the cabinets had kitchenware like glasses and plates instead of the normal sleep center supplies. I had an idea about what I could do for the Rolodex. I saw this three-sectioned container on the desk that could be readjusted and made into a Rolodex so I went back to the office to try that. I was talking to one of the construction workers about the expansion. I said, pretty soon, we're going to be all the way out to the road. He said that the plan was to eventually take over the whole lot. I said, 'yes, I realize that.",svsdc expand remodel storage cabinet sleep area look like kitchen cabinet door etch glass white knob cabinet white cool way expand build forklift lift one wall move walk around quite patient stand around two bed one brandy ask someone another sleep study stand sink clean something shape like lint roller metal hole thing stick really goopy stuff stand gag clean anne marie unknown wake life stand side sink face tell mucus also woman stand right woman er one sponsor carter remember name sympathetic even say clean piece meat maybe steak stand sink want lay want someone grab plate instead woman lay huge piece raw salmon counter lay steak top put bunch rolodex card rolodex overflow want buy another one go sleep area see could find another one storage back start talk susan complain thing back want u spend money office supply yet cabinet door replace expensive engrave glass also note cabinet kitchenware like glass plate instead normal sleep center supply idea could rolodex saw three sectioned container desk could readjust make rolodex go back office try talk one construction worker expansion say pretty soon go way road say plan eventually take whole lot say yes realize,13.453687,13.893364,466,2,6,1,2,4,1,1,7,4,14,2
1582,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,195,2001-03-18,"I was at my birth home with Bev, Bill F, and Brian F. The house had been sold and the people who had bought it came to work in the yard. I heard a lot of noise outside so I went to look out the window. I tried to do it so they wouldn't see me. I saw them using the rotary tiller in the flowerbeds by the backside of the porch. I knew daddy had told them they could use the lawn mower but I didn't know if this was okay. I wanted to call and let them know. None of us could remember the new phone number. We called BJ because we knew she would know it. When I got her on the phone, she gave me the number. One of the others handed me two pieces of paper but they were full of writing and I wasn't sure where to write the number down so I gave the pen to Bill F and told him to write it down. I talked to BJ about something else too. Mother and daddy showed up before I could call them. They were fine with what the new owners were doing. We went out to the garage. There were a lot of people sitting out there. Daddy pulled some grape branches down from the ceiling of the garage for Brian F to help him pick. I was so excited because I love grapes. There were green and purple ones both. I reached up and daddy pulled some branches down for me some to pick also but the ones he gave me just had single grapes on them instead of bunches so I had to pick them one at a time. After I finished I accidentally grabbed someone's foot. I looked at daddy and said I guess I can't pick the big toe can I? Or the others either? I felt embarrassed that I thought for a second that I could pick them. Daddy was sitting with some other men now and he told me there were more grapes up in the rafters but I would just have to climb up there to get them. I stepped on the bench between him and some other man to get myself up to the rafters. When I got up there, I turned around, looked down, and saw Aunt H and Aunt P were there with Aunt R. Aunt R looked really healthy, like she did years ago. She was standing and talking. At first, I didn't see any grapes in the rafters. Then I noticed some on the other side but didn't know how to get over there. There was a small beam that I could scoot across to get over there but it seemed scary to me, even though I knew I had done it before. The beam had stuffed store all along it and I didn't know if there was room for me. I also realized I could get down and climb back up the other side but that seemed like a pain. I did end up on the other side but I don't know how. When I got over there I saw bunches of grapes in bags like the kind you find in at a grocery store. These were all green. I thought this is great. I can freeze a bunch of these. Then I realized that some of them were already frozen. I then noticed that there were also packages of frozen meat up there. I didn't think about it then but I don't know how this stuff could have been frozen because it was just a storage space for all kinds of stuff/junk. The next scene I was talking to this black woman who couldn't walk on her own but I'm not sure how or why. She had pulled herself up by this cart, kind of like a hot dog vendor cart. She was going to try to walk around using that as a support. This man came in and she said something to him about being able to get around now and wanting to go on a date. We agreed to baby-sit the kids but I have no idea whose kids we were talking about except that it wasn't theirs. He finally agreed. Then I'm back up in the rafters and I see two stuffed dummies. The kind you might find sitting on a porch at Halloween where someone had stuffed clothes to make it look like a person. They were hanging from the rafters. They looked just like the two people that were going out on a date. The female dummy had her back to the male dummy and he had his arms around the female dummy as though he was supporting her. I saw other dummies hanging up there as well.",birth home bev bill brian house sell people buy come work yard hear lot noise outside go look window try see saw use rotary tiller flowerbed backside porch know daddy told could use lawn mower know okay want call let know none u could remember new phone number call bj know would know get phone give number one others hand two piece paper full writing sure write number give pen bill tell write talk bj something else mother daddy show could call fine new owner go garage lot people sit daddy pull grape branch ceiling garage brian help pick excite love grape green purple one reach daddy pull branch pick also one give single grape instead bunch pick one time finish accidentally grab someone foot look daddy say guess pick big toe others either felt embarrassed think second could pick daddy sit men tell grape rafter would climb get stepped bench man get rafter get turn around look saw aunt aunt aunt aunt look really healthy like year ago stand talk first see grape rafter notice side know get small beam could scoot across get seem scary even though knew beam stuff store along know room also realize could get climb back side seem like pain end side know get saw bunch grape bag like kind find grocery store green think great freeze bunch realize already frozen noticed also package frozen meat think know stuff could freeze storage space kinds stuff junk next scene talk black woman walk sure pull cart kind like hot dog vendor cart go try walk around use support man come say something able get around want go date agree baby sit kid idea whose kid talk except finally agree back rafter see two stuff dummy kind might find sit porch halloween someone stuff clothes make look like person hang rafter look like two people go date female dummy back male dummy arm around female dummy though support saw dummy hang well,14.041146,13.643311,822,2,7,2,3,9,5,4,9,9,18,2
1583,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,196,2001-03-19,"I was at a business conference in a hotel. Carmen A was there. Terri O was there. Angie Ho and Darren H and Annie H. I was in my room trying to change clothes. Angie Ho, Darren, and Annie H were there. I didn't have any clothes on and neither did Angie Ho. They all just stayed in the room, sat down, and started talking. I finally went in my closet and closed the door thinking they would get the hint and leave, but they didn't. I finally stuck my head out and said I really don't mean to be rude, but can I have some privacy? Angie Ho gave me this dirty look. I closed the door back up and they finally left. I got dressed and went out. Myself, Terri O, other CIIS group members were cleaning. We were getting ready for some execs. One of the men in charge came up to us and told us not to forget to clean this part of the banister at the bottom of the steps so I grabbed a rag and went down and cleaned it right away so we wouldn't forget. A few minutes later we were doing something else and he came by and looked at it then looked at it and then looked at us and smiled that we had remembered. It was really dusty and dirty. We went back upstairs and there was this little dog up there. It was a longhaired small dog. I asked what breed it was. The fur was really soft but it looked kind of like a beagle. Terri O said, no, it was a boxer. I was really surprised. When I looked at the face again I could kind of see the resemblance. There was this little puppy there too. The puppy was playing with the boxer. I thought, oh that boxer is so sweet I think I would like to have one like that. It kind of snipped at the puppy's mouth. I told it not to do that. Well, so much for that! I thought I wanted that dog! I know I don't now. The same man came back and was pointing out this painting, and said that the name was wrong on it. He said it was his son and that we needed to correct the signature on it. We did. He came by later and said tell them the story to point out that it was still wrong. I said, I'm sorry, I don't understand. Someone said the initials are supposed to be A.C. not S.A. Then after the man walked away I asked, why didn't he say that instead of telling us this whole story? Why didn't he just say, It's supposed to be A.C.? Then I walked into this conference room with this one man. I'm not sure who it was. I feel that I knew him but I can't identify him. We went in and sat down at a table to listen to a speaker. We were at a table with Carmen A and two of her friends. Her hair was really big and I touched it. It was hard with hair spray. She turned around and said, It looks really nice, doesn't it? I said, yes, it does. I didn't really think so. Then I went to another table to get a coffee cup. I came back, poured myself some coffee, and put an extraordinary amount of sweetener in it. I was looking for cream. I realized that I had to go to the back of the room to another table to get some cream. I didn't really want to but I realized that it was coffee with caffeine and I knew the effect it would have on me and I thought the creamer but lessen the effect somewhat. They didn't have any decaf so I went ahead and drank it because I really wanted coffee.",business conference hotel carmen terri angie ho darren annie room try change clothes angie ho darren annie clothe neither angie ho stay room sit start talk finally go closet close door thinking would get hint leave finally stick head say really mean rude privacy angie ho give dirty look close door back finally leave get dress go terri ciis group member clean get ready execs one men charge come u tell u forget clean part banister bottom step grab rag go clean right away forget minute later something else come look look look u smile remember really dusty dirty go back upstairs little dog longhaired small dog ask breed fur really soft look kind like beagle terri say boxer really surprised look face could kind see resemblance little puppy puppy play boxer think oh boxer sweet think would like one like kind snip puppy mouth tell well much think want dog know man come back point painting say name wrong say son need correct signature come later say tell story point still wrong say sorry understand someone say initial suppose man walk away ask say instead tell u whole story say suppose walk conference room one man sure feel knew identify go sat table listen speaker table carmen two friend hair really big touch hard hair spray turn around say look really nice say yes really think go another table get coffee cup come back poured coffee put extraordinary amount sweetener look cream realize go back room another table get cream really want realize coffee caffeine know effect would think creamer lessen effect somewhat decaf go ahead drank really want coffee,13.761611,13.676836,674,0,7,2,1,5,2,6,6,8,9,2
1584,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,197,2001-03-20,"I was with some of my family and I went to visit my house on Lakeland Dr. There were priests living in it now. As I walked around, the floor plan wasn't the same as it was in waking life. But I recognized things and was enjoying going through it. I looked out the window and pointed out that they had replaced our deck with something else. The fence that they had put up was kind of gaudy. It had big, thick, black posts with horse heads on the top. It was shiny. I don't know what the material was. if it was painted wood or some kind of metal. I was looking for my refrigerator. I finally walked into one room and there were two of them and one was mine. I said to Mother there it is and we went and looked specifically at the ice and water dispenser. After we left the house I realized that I had not looked at the kitchen or family room. I am planning to open my own store. I don't know what kind of store. I asked BJ and someone else to help me make a sign. I was going to put an advertisement in the church bulletin and someplace else and I thought we could make a poster board sign that would look like a real sign and then take a picture of it for in the ad. I was thinking of the kind of wood sign that you would find hanging out from the building outside of a store. like in the movie chocolate. BJ complained at first but then agreed to help. It was going to be pink lettering on a white background. I'm not sure where we are working on this. At first I thought we had room to work on them in my parents bedroom. But we were in this very large room with several large tables. all of my CRHP sisters are there to help but we aren't at my parents house. I have a sense that we are back at the rectory but it doesn't seem at all like my house on Lakeland so I'm not sure where we were. I had started making the sign. My CRHP sisters decided what kind of signs to make without asking me and had them done really quickly. They had made one for each holiday. They used lots of different colors. They just used large white paper instead of poster board. And they got rid of my initial sign of white poster board with pink lettering. They didn't say much about why they did that. They knew that I noticed but they kind of ignored it. I know they were all there but the ones I specifically remember were Theresa Ay, Theresa S, Judy D, Linda B, and Sheila G. We talked about how to transport these to my home or store. They said we could crease them but it was better not to. If we were going to fold them over without creasing, we should fold them over with the print on the inside. They had lots of glitter on them also. They were pretty but reminded me of things children would have made. which was not what I had wanted at all. I had wanted something simulating a real sign. Some of us folded the signs over and carried them outside to put in a car to take to my home. Others just let them hang freely and carried them out. Some of them had tape on the ends as though to hang them. They had also brought with them these huge containers of cookies and sweet rolls and such. We talked a little about what kind of store I was going to open. I joked that I was going to be a chocolatier. But the more I said it the more I liked the idea. I still don't know what I was going to do. When we got done with the signs we had to do something with all of these cookies. We started dividing them up among us so we each had a selection of everything. Most of us were putting ours in these huge roasting pans the size that would be used to serve a very large party. Some of them didn't want to take very many and were putting theirs in small plastic containers. Every time I thought we were done I would fine 2-3 more pans or trays. People started leaving and there were still pans of cookies left. I think we finally ended up getting them all divided except one final pan of chocolate cookies with chocolate chips. I asked whom all the empty pans belonged to. Some of them were the tin foil pans but there were also plastic containers. Some of the plastic ones I recognized as my own. There were two plastic ones that had pull out drawers. In each drawer were two recipe boxes. I looked inside the recipe boxes and they were empty. As we were loading up our cars I mentioned that I was looking for a new place to live. Someone said this would be a good time for me to move closer to the northeast side of town since Matthew will be leaving for college. I said I agreed but then stated that I already live on the NE. I don't know why I was moving or if I was trying to buy a condo or house again or just moving into another apartment. Some of my CRHP sisters wanted to go look at it with me before I decided for sure. I said that was fine and that we would see when they were available and go then. I was asking Theresa Ay for sure. At first I thought they could meet me at work and we would go from there then I realized that was a lot of extra driving for them so I would just give them the address and directions and meet them there.",family go visit house lakeland dr priest live walk around floor plan wake life recognize thing enjoy go look window point replace deck something else fence put kind gaudy big thick black post horse head top shiny know material paint wood kind metal look refrigerator finally walk one room two one mine say mother go look specifically ice water dispenser leave house realize look kitchen family room planning open store know kind store ask bj someone else help make sign go put advertisement church bulletin someplace else think could make poster board sign would look like real sign take picture ad thinking kind wood sign would find hang build outside store like movie chocolate bj complain first agree help go pink letter white background sure work first think room work parent bedroom large room several large table crhp sister help parent house sense back rectory seem like house lakeland sure start make sign crhp sister decide kind sign make without ask really quickly make one holiday use lot different color use large white paper instead poster board get rid initial sign white poster board pink letter say much knew notice kind ignore know one specifically remember theresa ay theresa judy linda sheila talk transport home store say could crease good go fold without crease fold print inside lot glitter also pretty reminded thing child would make want want something simulate real sign u fold sign carry outside put car take home others let hang freely carried tape end though hang also bring huge container cooky sweet roll talk little kind store go open joke go chocolatier say like idea still know go get sign something cooky start divide among u selection everything u put huge roasting pan size would use serve large party want take many put small plastic container every time think would fine pan tray people start leave still pan cooky leave think finally end get divide except one final pan chocolate cooky chocolate chip ask empty pan belong tin foil pan also plastic container plastic one recognize two plastic one pull drawer drawer two recipe box look inside recipe box empty load car mention look new place live someone say would good time move closer northeast side town since matthew leave college say agree state already live ne know move try buy condo house move another apartment crhp sister want go look decide sure say fine would see available go ask theresa ay sure first thought could meet work would go realized lot extra drive would give address direction meet,13.676308,13.603926,1019,1,17,3,1,13,3,3,17,5,24,2

1588,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,201,2001-03-24,I was driving through my mother's hometown. I had a young girl with me. I think she was African American. We came home and we were getting ready for bed. She ran into this bedroom a couple of times to this old woman to say goodnight. Where we were sleeping was surrounded by bookshelves. Some of the bookshelves formed like a square with just a little entryway. I was sleeping inside there and she was sleeping on the other side of one of the bookshelves. I gave her my blue sleeping bag and told her she could use it either as a sleeping bag or a comforter. She had hoped she would get to sleep on a bed and I told her no. I told her to go into the other bedroom and get a pillow off the bed to use. She brought those out and then she went into the older woman's bedroom again to say goodnight one more time.

There were these big square beams every few feet. I was flying under them I think and kind of hitting them as I flew under them. At the last one, there were two of them close together and they had a platform between them. I was crawling on that platform eating salad like a dog as I went along. Then I came to this baby. I realized it was a homeless baby. I saw this woman sitting down below so I took the baby to her. I asked her if she wanted a baby. She was so happy. She kept asking me if I was sure. Are you sure this is okay? She didn't want to take it if it was someone else's baby. I said, no, someone else deserted it, so you may have it. Then the baby started crying and I went to get it some milk. There was a handicapped young man sitting there and he was putting something in the baby bottle that he shouldn't. I told him, don't ever, ever put that in the bottle again because that will really, really hurt the baby. I took a bottle and cleaned it out really good.

1590,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,203,2001-03-24,"I was inside this house. It was a big fancy house. There was a party there. The owner of the house was Dabney Coleman. I think he's kind of gross. We were in this house and he made a pass at me. Then he took me into his bedroom, but there were all these other people in there. Actually, the bedroom was kind of like a very large suite of rooms with no doors, just large openings between areas. It was almost as though it was partitioned off rather than having walls. It was very contemporary. Everything had very contemporary curvy lines to them. I really don't know how to explain this at all. Anyway, he chased all the people out. I whispered something to him. I realized there were more people in there still. He was trying to get all of them out. When he finally got them all out, we realized his wife was there. She was talking to him and flirting with him physically as though nothing was going on. She didn't see me there. I tried to sneak out and she saw me. I ran out the door and instead of running down two flights of steps, I jumped over the rail and landed two floors down. I thought I was safe there but she threw something and it hit me.

1591,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,204,2001-03-24,"Matthew was cleaning the woodwork in the apartment but he didn't think what he was doing was working. I told him that I thought it was and pointed out on the one he was working on that I could see where he had cleaned and where he hadn't. He was working on the upstairs bathroom. I told him he needed to step out for a minute because I needed to use it. After I closed the door I realized the toilet was about to overflow. I flushed it several times and was playing with the mechanisms in the tank trying to get it fixed. I didn't want to use the plunger but was about to tell Matthew that he needed to get the plunger and fix it. Just at that time, some people came in and I realized they had been working in that bathroom. It was apartment maintenance men. I didn't even know they had been in there and done anything. I hadn't called them to do anything. They replaced the upstairs toilet with an older toilet that was all cracked around the rim and nasty looking. Where it was cracked, there were several colors light blue and yellow and I don't remember what other colors. They had also replaced the sink and counter fixture with this big ugly unit that had two trashcans built in, the kind you might see in some public bathrooms and it was a maroon color. It was also a double sink but the one sink was fairly small and rectangular in shape and the other one was round and regular size. I didn't like it at all. I questioned them as to why they were doing this when there was nothing wrong with the old fixtures. They didn't give me good answers. I didn't like the work at all. They basically just ignored me. Then a woman came in while they were here. She was from the apartment office and she said her name was Lao. I told her that as soon as these men left I would be calling her to talk to her about this. They gave me a form to sign and fill out. On several places on the form, I made it very clear that I did not like the work that they had done. That I had not requested it. That it was poor quality. One of them at one point said this isn't going to be good while he was watching me fill out the form. I just ignored him and kept writing. It wasn't the normal form that I fill out and sign when I have work done here. Then they pointed out a place for me to write some extensive comments. I wanted to get one of my own pens because the pen they gave me wasn't working well at all. I guess I thought. I don't know if I was actually talking to someone on the phone or if I was just thinking. When I called the apartment complex, I told them that I don't have a problem with John D or any of the men that normally work for him at all. They almost always do an excellent job. However, I was not pleased with this at all. As someone who has lived here almost four years, I think this is inappropriate to come in and have something like this done without my knowledge or consent.

1594,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,207,2001-04-07,"I was driving a car and Matthew was a little boy. He was in the front seat with me. We were driving around my mother's hometown. The weather was really bad. I was on my way to take him to school. I stopped by a little mini-mart place. I was going to buy a book of matches. There were two cigarette machines there that you could also get matches from. I was afraid to try them because I didn't want the cigarettes, only the matches. I leaned my hand against one of the machines to balance myself while I stepped over this guardrail so I could go into the store. When I did that, I found a dollar and some change, two quarters, a penny, and others. I went in the store and got in line. Just before it was my turn at the register, I saw another man come in and pick up a book of matches. He showed it to the clerk and walked out. I went ahead and grabbed a book but then it was my turn. I laid it on the counter and paid 26 cents for it. The clerk didn't get me any change. I walked out of the store and then realized I walked out with the matches. I decided that maybe I should buy a pack of cigarettes. I got out of line and then I had to get back at the end of the line because I thought I would have to get them from the cashier. Then it was my turn again. I just bought he matches, no cigarettes. I left the store and realized that I had forgotten the matches. I went back in to get them from the cashier and I saw a book lying there. I started to pick them up. He stopped me, grabbed another pack of matches, he did something to them, put them in an 8.5 x 11 sheet protector, and handed them to a cashier. She headed back to the back of the store. I followed her and asked for my matches. She said, Well we have to give you a test before you are allowed to have them. I said excuse me? I am a doctoral student. I am late for work. I have really got to go. Can I PLEASE have my matches? She just gave them to me and let me go. I got in the car and the windows were steamed up because it was cold and snowy out. Matthew had fallen asleep holding a stuffed animal. We talked a little, but I don't remember what we talked about. I was driving and the roads were really bad. It's as though I was driving on top of these big mounds of snow on the road. I thought, well, now I understand why they asked people to stay at home and they asked people to drive their own kids to school. I don't think I took him to school. I ended up at a friend's house. It was a black family. I think I dropped Matthew off there. I told them about the incident with the matches and needing to be tested to get a pack of matches. They all laughed and thought it was ridiculous too. I got ready to leave without Matthew and they asked me if there were any more Anastasia books in the series. I stepped back in the house, closed the door again, and told them I honestly didn't remember but I thought there were a bunch in the series. I suggested they check the library. I was buying the matches to light and burn my old palms. I thought about getting the cigarettes because I thought it might be easier to light the palms from a lit cigarette. I thought if I bought the cigarettes, Matthew would see me light it and I would have to say, Yes, I did try smoking once.",drive car matthew little boy front seat drive around mother hometown weather really bad way take school stop little mini mart place go buy book match two cigarette machine could also get match afraid try want cigarette match lean hand one machine balance step guardrail could go store found dollar change two quarter penny others go store get line turn register saw another man come pick book match show clerk walk go ahead grab book turn lay counter pay cent clerk get change walk store realize walk match decide maybe buy pack cigarette get line get back end line think would get cashier turn buy match cigarette leave store realize forgotten match go back get cashier saw book lie start pick stop grab another pack match something put sheet protector hand cashier head back back store follow ask match say well give test allow say excuse doctoral student late work really get go please match give let go got car window steam cold snowy matthew fall asleep hold stuff animal talk little remember talk drive road really bad though drive top big mound snow road think well understand ask people stay home ask people drive kid school think take school end friend house black family think drop matthew tell incident match need test get pack match laugh think ridiculous get ready leave without matthew ask anastasia book series step back house close door tell honestly remember thought bunch series suggest check library buying match light burn old palm think get cigarette think might easier light palm light cigarette think buy cigarette matthew would see light would say yes try smoking,14.033606,13.420828,668,3,4,4,4,1,5,2,6,12,8,2
1595,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,208,2001-04-09,"Very bloody and gory. It started out that I was watching the whole event. Like a bunch of people and dignitaries going to their very formal ball, a royal ball maybe. The only person I recognize is the woman who plays CJ on West Wing. Some of the people were dressed to sneak in and kill a lot of the people in attendance. They were particularly interested in killing anyone associated with this one vicar of the Catholic Church. They specifically killed one priest that was in their way. He was killed by the _____ the priest _____ an acquaintance so it took the priest completely by surprise. There was as green tablecloth with two spots on it. One of the killers poured some wine on both spots. Then someone said, that means that you're going to kill me too. The killer said, yes, you are wise. There was a chase with that person who was to be killed as they tried to get away, but they didn't. When the killers first entered, this one woman that I recognized, her date was one of the killer but she didn't realize it until he made the signal. Then all of the killers that were with him started attacking. She was trained in self-defense because she successfully killed or surprised several of the killers and remained safe. There were two girls, late teenagers, sisters, that were running away. They were with the killers and had been asked to kill these two little girls. That was over the line for them so they were trying to run away. Their mother was not one of the killers. She kept calling to them, Come back, Come back and we'll forgive you. The one girl gave up trying to run away and stayed with the killers. The other one came back to be with her Mom and her family. Where the one woman and the one killer were getting dressed to go to the event there was something about jewelry. It was as though I had displayed this jewelry but I don't know how to explain this.

I took it out of the plastic wrapper and unfolded it. I laid it out and on top of some trees and bushes. I wondered about cutting holes in it to get it around the trees. It didn't cover the whole front yard. The very front had a small embankment. I went and looked at the backyard to see about putting it there. I decided it would fit well there either. A friend of Matthew's said they were looking at that for their yard. I said I wasn't sure I like it anymore. I told him I was going to need three of them for the front yard alone. Darren said he wanted some time alone so he was going out for breakfast and a hike. He had a backpack on. As he walked away, I was thinking that he doesn't know how far it is to the restaurant. There were lots of Matthew's friends around. I was in the bathroom and some of them opened the door, came in, washed their hands, and then left again. They didn't knock and didn't say a word about me being in there.

1597,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,210,2001-04-17,"I was working somewhere but I don't know where. I think it was a medical office. They put me in the back office and made me a filing clerk. The manager always made sure everyone else was placed above me. They brought a new man into work next to me but doing slightly different abilities. He kind of reminds me of Cal U. Someone came back, was talking to him and asked him what he does there. He said he is a filing clerk. My first thought was what is he doing in a job like this? Then I thought that's good that he's not letting his ego keep him from being responsible. Some vendors brought in a bunch of merchandise to sell to employees. They set up booths to display it all. They had jewelry and furniture. I went to look at the rings but by the time I got there, all of the medium size ones were gone. All that was left were very dainty ones and huge ones. One was like a neon light. It kept changing colors. Betty N was there. I started walking around to look at other things. There were very large wooden pieces of furniture. I opened this one unusual chest. I liked it but decided it wasn't quite what I was looking for. I was walking around Susan J. We looked at some kitchen furniture. I asked her if she saw anything she couldn't live without. She said no. We kept walking and saw various knick-knacks behind colored glassware. I went back to my desk and tried to call Tim W again. He worked for the same company. I had left a message a day on sales floor. I had also gone to his office to try to find him and talk to him. When I tried to call this time, I got a wrong number first. I looked in a book for a number to get the corporate directory on voice mail. When I got his number, I got through but I heard him talking to someone else. I hung up but then called back.

1600,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,213,2001-04-21,"I went to the YMCA with a bunch of women from church. I don't think they were my CRHP sisters. In fact, I didn't know anyone. One person was there as our trainer to get us started on a program. Some of the women were having more difficulty than I was. I was trying to be encouraging and supportive to them. I told one in particular that I wasn't trying to be pushy, that I was only trying to be her cheerleader. She and one or two of the others were wearing dresses to work out. They were kind of out-of-style. Straight, cotton, pastels with collars, belted waist and button down the front. As one of them was working out, I saw the trainer behind her kind of spotting the weights. Although there was no need to because it was a weight machine. One of the weights did kind of stick or something at first as they sometimes do. I was waiting my turn sitting on another machine. While I was waiting, I could see into another part of the gym. Through glass windows, I noticed my name on one of the machines. At first, I thought it said, or meant, that I passed on it the last time, meaning I didn't use it. I then realized that it said something was completed. I realized that it had been a long time since I had been there so I figured not many people use that machine if my name was still on it. When we were done, I went to get my puppy out of this one room before going home. Someone there had been watching him for me. He was actually there for another reason but had agreed to watch him for me while I worked out. There were puppies running around all over the place. There was a woman sitting on the ground with her kids. I think they were having a picnic. Their puppy was running around also. The name of their puppy was Monica. They said they chose that name because it's an unusual name for a puppy. I said I had named my puppy that for the same reason but it was also the name of its mother. I was kneeling on the floor and these puppies were running all around me. There were two bulldogs that were really bothering me. I thought they were going to bite me. One was brown with green spots. I kept pushing them away and I wanted to get up but it was as though I was paralyzed there. I did finally get up but I don't know how. I still couldn't seem to get away from the puppies. I was talking to Matthew about paying him $5 and how to get it to him .I told him I would mail it to him but he said his wife could come pick it up. I asked him how much longer he would be there and he said at least another hour. My puppy was playing behind the closed door so I told Matthew I would leave the puppy with him while I went to my locker to get my things and then I could pay him. When I went to the locker room, I accidentally went into the men's locker room. I saw the men in the hot tub and realized what I had done. I left and again, mistakenly, went into the other men's locker room. When I finally went into the women's, there were three different sections. I realized that I didn't remember which locker I had used or the number on it. I started trying my key in all the locks. I was afraid someone would see me. My key opened some of the locks but they weren't mine. Sometimes I had trouble getting the things back inside to close it. Many of the lockers were very small, maybe 18 inches by 6 inches. Some of them I left unlocked because I could get the things back in. There were some very unusual locks too that I had to do certain things in order to relock them. I was getting very upset that I didn't remember and that I couldn't find it. I was worried what people would think. I also worried that may be I had mistakenly used one of the men's lockers. One aisle of the women's lockers was very narrow. I started checking these but then realized I would not have used them because of the narrow aisle. I finally gave up, went, and told Matthew what happened. I was very upset because I said my keys were in there too. I then realized I had the car key hidden on the car. Then I could get home and the apartment office could let me in the house. I also then realized that I usually have my purse under the front seat of the car when I go into the YMCA so maybe I had done that this time.",go ymca bunch woman church think crhp sister fact know anyone one person trainer get u start program woman difficulty try encourage supportive tell one particular try pushy try cheerleader one two others wear dress work kind style straight cotton pastel collar belt waist button front one work saw trainer behind kind spot weight although need weight machine one weight kind stick something first sometimes wait turn sit another machine waiting could see another part gym glass windows notice name one machine first think say meant pas last time meaning use realize say something complete realize long time since figure many people use machine name still go get puppy one room go home someone watch actually another reason agree watch work puppy run around place woman sit ground kid think picnic puppy run around also name puppy monica say chose name unusual name puppy say name puppy reason also name mother kneel floor puppy run around two bulldog really bother think go bite one brown green spot keep push away want get though paralyze finally get know still seem get away puppy talk matthew pay get tell would mail say wife could come pick ask much long would say least another hour puppy playing behind closed door tell matthew would leave puppy go locker get thing could pay go locker room accidentally go men locker room saw men hot tub realize leave mistakenly go men locker room finally go woman three different section realize remember locker use number start try key lock afraid someone would see key open lock mine sometimes trouble get thing back inside close many locker small maybe inch inch leave unlock could get thing back unusual lock certain thing order relock get upset remember find worried people would think also worried may mistakenly use one men lockers one aisle woman locker narrow start check realize would use narrow aisle finally give go told matthew happen upset say key realize car key hidden car could get home apartment office could let house also realize usually purse front seat car go ymca maybe time,13.860168,13.366695,854,5,12,2,5,8,8,6,14,12,13,2

1602,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,215,2001-04-23,"It was like watching a beautiful movie unfold and yet I was the main character. The somatic feelings were such that I didn't want to awaken. I didn't want to ever leave my bed. I felt warm and tingly all over. I felt so much love that I thought my heart would burst. I felt peace and safety like none I have ever felt before. I was living in another time and another culture. Yet I cannot identify either. It was a time of honor and simplicity, yet the home I lived in was very comfortable by today's standards. It almost had a feeling and look of what I imagine to be old Mexico or Spain, yet my family and I were Caucasian. I wish more than ever that I were an artist so I could sit immediately at my easel and paint the images in my mind so as to never lose them. It was nearly a year before I was to be married. The parents of both my betrothed and myself were very involved in the commitment. [Through most of the dream] I did not spend time with my betrothed. I saw him only on occasion with his father, as they came to check on me. They wanted to be sure that nothing would interfere with the marriage. My father had hired a bodyguard for me. His name was Victor. One day Victor and I were sitting at the kitchen table, each at a different side of the table, yet sitting next to each other. We were discussing life and some of the disparities in our two lives. I felt his pain as he shared with me how unaccepted he is in so many areas because of his heritage. I believe he was of Spanish decent. Victor was a tall man with bronze-colored skin. His hair was jet black and smooth as silk. His chiseled features and dark eyes were always noticed when he entered a room. I don't know if it was his appearance that got him noticed or the feel of his presence. He told me that he must be careful guarding me, as he must guard himself too. People living in my area would be happy to kill him rather than watch him roam our streets, even acting as my bodyguard. I felt so much pain and sorrow at this. Yet, he would not give up his position as my bodyguard. I rose from my chair and hugged him, cradling his head to my chest and caressing his hair. I kissed him lightly on the head. He looked up at me and I kissed him lightly on the lips. I quickly apologized. From the look in his eyes, I could not tell what he was thinking. He told me not to apologize. A few months later, I was at my bridal shower. All of my girlfriends and women relatives were there. My father was also there. I had such a warm and loving relationship with my father. I was sitting on an ottoman in front of him, with my arms stretched behind me embracing his gray and balding head as he leaned forward to cradle me in his arms and rest his chin on my shoulder. The women were playing a game. Each had a card made of colored construction paper and folded in half. The inside of each card was white with colored markings on it. Each one represented a man I had dated. One woman would read characteristics and then each of the other would mark their card if that man had those characteristics. The characteristics they read were both good and bad. I quickly made an additional card representing my father. I said I wanted to see how many of them compared to my father. Victor came and sat at the edge of the room in a rocking chair. His quiet, calm, strong presence permeated the air in the room. As always, this left me feeling unsettled, as I felt it deep in my soul. I secretly wanted to make a card for Victor. Later that evening there was a party for all of our family and friends, male and female. We were laughing and dancing. I asked Victor to dance with me. Just as I asked, the music changed to a ballad. Victor quickly agreed to dance with me. I felt the butterflies in my stomach as Victor took my hand and wrapped his arm gently around my waist, pulling me close, but not too. Our dancing in rhythm was effortless, as though we had been life-long dance partners. I could feel that we both wanted nothing more than to be closer and to gaze into each other's eyes. We dared not say anything for fear the other would say they did not feel the same thing. We dared not, for fear others would notice. I finally gave in ever so slightly, when I rested my head on his chest as we continued to dance. Weeks later, my family and friends were outdoors playing in the swimming pool. They had placed a cover over the pool so you could walk and run on it with only a few inches of water on top. They also had something spraying water into the air and people were running about in the spraying water and atop the pool. Even my father was joining in the fun. I was standing near the back by a stone wall, under a tree, with Victor. He was so enjoying watching the fun, envious because he had never experienced a family such as this. I was trying to encourage him to join us. For the first time, in the shadows of the tree, he made his feelings for me known. He ever so gently touched my breast, as if by accident, but I knew it was not an accident. I asked him if he did not want to be with me as much as I wanted to be with him. I could see the affirmation in his eyes. Yet, I was betrothed to another and Victor was employed by my father to be my bodyguard. He dared not say the words. A short time later, my betrothed and his father and two other men drove into the courtyard. They were in a car that reminded me of something a mobster would drive. They exchanged words with my father, warning that nothing should interfere with the wedding, which was scheduled for the next day. I was standing at a laptop computer, sitting on a pedestal. I was playing some kind of games that tested your mind. A woman, related to my betrothed came up and started poking fun and trying to make me miss the answers. I realized at that point that I could not go through with this marriage. I walked up an iron, circular staircase with another woman. I don't know if it was a sister or a friend. The staircase led to a veranda. My mother was already there, laying on an upholstered chaise lounge. She immediately called for my father to join us. When my father arrived, he said he was going to call off the wedding because he had just learned that my betrothed had been unfaithful to me. I was overjoyed. I sat by my mother on the chaise lounge. She had covered herself with a beautiful red silk shawl. As I gently leaned on my mother's side, I cautiously told them of my feelings for Victor and that I believed he felt the same, but was unwilling to say so because of his position. My father was overjoyed at the prospect of a union between Victor and myself. I say my mother's support and approval in her eyes. He called for Victor. After a brief conversation, he asked Victor if he would like to take my hand in marriage. Before Victor had a chance to respond, he said that it would bring him great joy to witness such a union. Victor said, he too, would be honored and overjoyed. My father said the wedding would go ahead as planned, with one exception. The groom would be Victor. Once alone with Victor we were able to finally express our feelings for each other, and our joy at our upcoming marriage. We recognized the beauty of our first night together being on our wedding night.",like watch beautiful movie unfold yet main character somatic feeling want awaken want ever leave bed felt warm tingly felt much love think heart would burst felt peace safety like none ever felt live another time another culture yet identify either time honor simplicity yet home live comfortable today standard almost feel look imagine old mexico spain yet family caucasian wish ever artist could sit immediately easel paint image mind never lose nearly year marry parent betroth involve commitment dream spend time betroth saw occasion father come check wanted sure nothing would interfere marriage father hire bodyguard name victor one day victor sit kitchen table different side table yet sit next discuss life disparity two life felt pain share unaccepted many area heritage believe spanish decent victor tall man bronze color skin hair jet black smooth silk chisel feature dark eye always notice entered room know appearance get notice feel presence tell must careful guard must guard people live area would happy kill rather watch roam street even act bodyguard felt much pain sorrow yet would give position bodyguard rise chair hug cradle head chest caress hair kiss lightly head look kiss lightly lips quickly apologize look eye could tell think told apologize month later bridal shower girlfriend woman relatives father also warm loving relationship father sit ottoman front arm stretch behind embrace gray bald head lean forward cradle arm rest chin shoulder woman play game card make colored construction paper fold half inside card white color mark one represent man date one woman would read characteristic would mark card man characteristic characteristic read good bad quickly make additional card represent father say want see many compare father victor come sat edge room rock chair quiet calm strong presence permeate air room always leave feel unsettle felt deep soul secretly want make card victor later even party family friends male female laugh dance ask victor dance ask music change ballad victor quickly agree dance felt butterfly stomach victor take hand wrap arm gently around waist pull close dance rhythm effortless though life long dance partner could feel want nothing closer gaze eye dare say anything fear would say feel thing dare fear others would notice finally give ever slightly rest head chest continue dance week later family friend outdoors play swim pool place cover pool could walk run inch water top also something spraying water air people run spray water atop pool even father join fun stand near back stone wall tree victor enjoy watch fun envious never experience family try encourage join u first time shadow tree make feeling know ever gently touch breast accident know accident ask want much want could see affirmation eye yet betroth another victor employ father bodyguard dare say word short time later betroth father two men drive courtyard car remind something mobster would drive exchange word father warn nothing interfere wed schedule next day stand laptop computer sit pedestal playing kind game test mind woman relate betroth come start poke fun try make miss answer realize point could go marriage walk iron circular staircase another woman know sister friend staircase lead veranda mother already lay upholstered chaise lounge immediately call father join u father arrive say go call wedding learn betroth unfaithful overjoyed sit mother chaise lounge cover beautiful red silk shawl gently lean mother side cautiously tell feel victor believe felt unwilling say position father overjoyed prospect union victor say mother support approval eye call victor brief conversation ask victor would like take hand marriage victor chance respond say would bring great joy witness union victor say would honor overjoy father say wed would go ahead plan one exception groom would victor alone victor able finally express feel joy upcoming marriage recognize beauty first night together wed night,13.72525,13.667194,1410,8,22,9,13,27,15,9,33,20,60,2

We were simultaneously on the island and in the parking lot at the same time. Andy decided he would win by cutting Colby's hand off while he was sleeping.

I wanted to get down in the crevice and have someone take a picture for my audition video, but I couldn't fit in. Someone thinner than me did fit in. I noticed that the crevice started closing up. Someone and I kept pushing against one side of it to try to move it and keep it open. We were trying to rock it, the way you would a car stuck in mud. There was water on the other side of the crevice. As we rocked it the water started splashing over and all of a sudden we wanted to turn and run away before the water got us. When we turned around, we realized we had to swim to get back to land. We did. I was in someone's home and had emptied a 2-liter soda bottle. I took it to the woman of the house and asked her where the trashcan is so I could throw it away. She didn't understand me because she did not speak English. Someone else came up, interpreted for me, and told me where to take the bottle, which I did. One member of the tem came out with a squirt gun filled with hot sauce. She was squirting everyone. None of us liked that because we wearing the only clothing we were able to take with us and now it had hot sauce on it. We went and washed it off as best we could. I went to use the bathroom twice. The bathrooms were very unusual. I thought I better get used to it because soon I would only have the great outdoors to use. Oddly, I thought that would be better than this. We were in a restaurant. I was sitting a table with four other women. I was sitting in the middle of two of them. Two sitting across from e. The waiter came and took orders from three of them but didn't ask the other two of us if we wanted anything. The woman sitting next to me asked if they had anything decaf. He said, No! So she said she didn't want anything. At that point, I said I didn't either if they didn't have anything decaf. Later there were several of us standing around talking. One of the women looked like she was six or seven months pregnant. She was saying when her delivery could happen, that it might happen while we are out. I said, we might be delivering a baby there. She started saying something and pushing on her stomach and pulled out a huge sweater. She had just been playing around, teasing us. Myself and one other woman were walking around a wooded area. There was no snow on the ground. We were looking at pieces of bark lying on the ground. We were talking about how that would work really well to build a shelter. I was walking along what seemed to be a beach. I reached down and ran my hand through the sand because it was so pretty. I realized that it was more like gravel. It was very smooth and felt good to the touch. I was running along and running my fingers through this gravel.

I explained about the Maori drawing. Then started drawing with the lights very dim. I let them go too long. When we got done, I suggested we take a ten-minute break because the next part would take ten to fifteen minutes per person. When we got back together from the break, I noticed how elaborate some of the drawings were. I had forgotten to tell them to draw a circle first, yet many of them had done that and drawn the symbols in the circle. I started to give them the rest of the instructions, but they wanted us all to hold hands and walk in a circle while I was doing this. I stayed outside the circle while they did it. I told them I needed to stand still while I was reading it. When I got ready to pull my own drawing out, I told them they could share as much or as little as they like. I said I would show them mine from a distance and point out some things. God, toys, children, family. When I spoke of specific things in mine, there was a basketball game on it. I said it was there because of the large audience that I felt represented ministering to the public. Karen E made a joke about the game, I think asking me who was playing, and I said I didn't know.

1617,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,230,2001-05-18,"I went to work for a woman business owner. The job was something about presenting programs to groups. I was talking to one of her employees about ADHD and how it affects your life. We thought it would be a great idea to market a program about ADD, educating people about signs and symptoms, treatment, living with ADD, how people with ADD are treated by others. The owner of the business liked the idea. She said the other employee could do all the clerical work and I could just do the presenting. I told her I thought it would be a full-time job so why not build enough into the cost of the program to pay me as a full-time employee and let me handle most of that: registration calls, set arrangements, etc. I think she agreed. I told her I had a voice mail only number that we could use and that I would put together a business plan. She didn't seem to see a need for a business plan. Her other employee wanted to try my meds for ADD. They both wanted to get something to drink first. Then I gave her one _ pill, telling her that's all she should take.

1618,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,231,2001-05-19,"I was downloading software and trying to send an IM to Daddy. Maybe I sent it to Mother and he answered. He was going to tell me how to finish downloading my software. It turned out not to be a problem but I realized I didn't get back to him after that, so I sent another IM. This one I sent to Mother. I'm at Mother and Daddy's at the old house. She is sitting in the kitchen at her computer and I walked by and the computer screen is facing me and I comment about how dirty her computer screen is and that it needs to be cleaned. I wiped it with my fingers but then I went and got some paper towels and Windex and cleaned it for her. I don't know if I said this or if I just thought it. I think I said it. This is one thing I will definitely clean when I see it needs to be cleaned. Then I'm back at my computer at home and realized I hadn't continued my IM conversation with Mother. I type in something about being sorry because I had to leave to go get some milk. I'm back now. I'm in my car, again, and headed home. There's a computer keyboard and monitor in front of me where the steering wheel is. I'm driving and having a really hard time seeing the road. I thought to myself, how do I normally see around or over this thing? I can't see the road so I'm trying to look around it. I'm raising myself off the seat so I can look around the monitor and see the road. I think, maybe if I raise the seat higher. I don't usually. So what's different? There's a car pulling a huge trailer across a one-lane wood bridge. I don't see it in time. I drive off the road and around the bridge and back onto the road. The road then turns into an unusual looking railroad track. Then I think, oh, great now I'm driving on a railroad track. I'm driving on a railroad track and up a mountain. I'm thinking, this is so weird and the worst part is that it is not a dream because I know I'm not dreaming. I keep going and then I can see the vehicle that I'm driving going up the mountain but it has like four other vehicles or trailers attached to it that it is pulling. It runs into the train and starts pushing the train up the mountain. I'm talking to this man, I'm complaining about the whole incident with the train and the bridge. I have this toy-size car and trailers that I was driving. I show him what happened driving up the mountain. I tell him it was entirely his fault because I had called his company to come to the house/farm and do something and he didn't do it. I'm demonstrating backing all this down the mountain and back to my property. Football players and one of the players crossed the end zone. As he got there, he jumped in the air, turned around, and caught the football. I think it was me. As I was having it, I was thinking, oh, I'm not awake yet, I need to make sure I record it.

I also had a fan out in the yard blowing on the yard or the garden where I was watering also. I was training to become some kind of a pilot. Anthony Edwards was my instructor and I only had about five lessons. The last one is the one I remember most. In that one, we were going to learn how to get height and how to go back down by pulling the handle bar or steering wheels toward you to go up and away from you to go down. Before my lesson, I got in a simulator and practiced. At first, I was terrible. I would go up really fast and down really fast. It was really awful. I practiced enough to get the nuance that by the time it was time for my lesson I did really well. After that, I found out that I passed, that I was now a certified pilot, and that I was one of the best in my class.

Maybe that's why I though I couldn't get around it. I decided to just fly over the fence to get home. Even after I flew over the fence, I couldn't find my house.

1622,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,235,2001-05-23,"I was at a kind of indoor flea market. It reminded me of the antique mall across the street but it didn't seem to be antiques, or at least not all antiques. When I first walked in there were these children dressed up in toy-like costumes. They were standing perfectly still until I entered the room and then they started running around. One of them came up and hugged me. One of them, a girl, had her head bent down and was brushing her head up away from her neck. She had said she wasn't hot but I noticed a red rash on her neck and asked again as it reminded me of heat rash. Then she said yes, she was hot. One of the things that I saw in the market was a jewelry armoire filled with LRJ and books. At first, I didn't know what it was until I saw the books. As I picked up a book, a man working there said he was just now reading the book but if I had questions, he would help me. I looked to see if they had any of the items that I now own that are damaged or pieces missing, like one earring missing. They didn't. I didn't recognize any of the pieces they had. I closed the armoire and moved on. I went into a room and saw all of the chains of big colored, plastic beads lying all over the floor. Someone told us what they were, but I don't remember now what they called them. Another woman shopping there thought they were great. She started looking at them to purchase some of them. Someone took some of them apart and there were beads rolling around all over the floor. Someone picked up something else to show us how easy these beads were to pick up. She stuck this thing in the beads, it picked up several at once, and then she put them in a bucket of sorts. I tried it, as did a few other people. It was interesting how it worked. I decided to leave. I finally found an exit but it led into a maze. I hesitated momentarily because I really don't like mazes. They make me claustrophobic and I'm afraid I can't get out. I went ahead. It was all wood, top, bottom, and sides. There was a tape playing while you went through it. It was a male voice of an advertisement for the flea market/store. At one point in the maze, you had to lie down to continue going through and something kind of sucked/pushed you through. I really didn't want to do that but didn't think I had a choice and it was very short so I went ahead. At the end of the maze, there was another place like this. I went ahead since the first one was no big deal. However, this one turned out to be very long. I started getting panicky and trying to figure out a way out. It finally let me out on the outside of the market.

We came back I was going to church. TH with family. I was sitting outside and there were a lot of table and chairs sitting outside in the grass. People were sitting there eating. I had a McDonald's meal and was going to sit down and eat it before going in to Mass. I was having trouble finding a place to sit. I finally ended up sitting on a cement wall. While I was eating, the church choir came out and started practicing. They were in three sections, but they played instruments also. One section was playing violin and singing and I thought that was unusual. Everybody went in for Mass. I went in, went to one section, and saw that there were a lot of seats. It was a side section of the church. It was kind of behind a wall so you couldn't see very well. I went to check another section first. Then I saw my whole family sitting there and they waved for me to come up and sit with them. I did, but it was really, really tight.

You could also see animals walking through the animals. You could just see their horns and ears sticking out of the water. We were holding hands and wading through the water. I wasn't afraid at all. I think we were in Africa. We were outdoors. Suddenly there were snakes everywhere. At first, I wasn't afraid, but I was avoiding them. Someone was shooting at them and killing them. I suddenly realized that I had this huge snake on my back but it looked more like an octopus. Then I got scared and started jerking. I think I was trying to either shake it off or just got scared and had an involuntary muscle reaction. The person that was shooting kept telling me to turn a little bit so he could get a clear shot at the snake. I was too scared to move yet I kept jerking. We were still outdoors and close to my home. Everyone on my tribe was supposed to be displaying all of our accomplishments in our life so far, certifications, awards, and things like that. Somebody had displayed their professional accomplishments where the others were related to survivor. I asked someone about it and they said it wasn't necessary. I said, well, maybe not. However, if they are going to display theirs then I want to display mine as well or else it looks like I don't have any. They agreed that was fine. I went home, took all my plaques off the wall, and was putting them in canvass bags to carry them. There were two huge binders full of something that I moved. I was going through the binders looking for a group photo of SAID members with Barry C. He had signed an 8 x 10. I was looking for it, because Patricia S had displayed hers. I thought if she has hers out there then I went mine out there. I really didn't see this as an accomplishment though. I brought them back and was getting ready to display them on the tables where my other tribe members had displayed theirs. They had everything scattered. I was trying to make room for mine, while keeping their things all together. This one man's accomplishments were all of these creatures, like insects and reptiles that he had in plastic cases. I started to move them and I realized they were alive. One of them was a snake all coiled up. It made me jump. Another member, all she had were pieces of paper with things written on them. I don't know what language, maybe Chinese. She had three groups of them. They were little scraps of paper that she had written on. She put them in three groups and made labels for each group. She had laid these in the shape of a rainbow. I went to move them and I got them all pushed together.

1627,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,240,2001-05-28,"I was doing a dream group for family. Aunt H, Aunt P, Aunt J, cousins, women from St. Joe, Aunt A, and some of my own family. I was at Mother and Daddy's house. I went up to school to get a few things and finish putting my materials together and stuff. I then went to the church and realized that I must be late because there were so many cars in the parking lot. I looked at my watch and it said 3:77. I knew I must be 20 minutes late maybe. Someone met me outside and took me into a side door of the church but it ended up being this big meeting room. Paulette W and her son were there also. He was playing video games and stuff right behind me. She said she hoped it wouldn't be a problem. Of course, I couldn't say anything. I handed out the folders. There was a TV playing and I realized I kept getting distracted by the TV. I was supposed to be conducting this group and I kept finding myself doing nothing more than standing there watching this TV. I suggested we turn the TV off and yet later I realized the same thing was happening again. I don't know how the TV got turned back on. I was feeling disorganized and my thoughts were very fragmented. It wasn't going well at all. I was back outside and going back inside. This time the church looked different. Big white church with very steep or deep white cement steps. I started to walk in but my eye was really bothering me. I couldn't see out of it. I was becoming less stable on my feet. Alan K walked up and opened the door for me. I walked in and had my hand over my bad eye. I was walking slowly and stepping carefully. I couldn't use one of the steps because it was too wobbly and I couldn't see well enough. He took my arm and helped me find my way to the bottom of these steps and to a step. Then I told everyone what was going on with my eye and I felt like I was getting a cold and I was just feeling that it wasn't going well at all and I really didn't like that. Having said all that, I hope you don't mind but I'm going to go ahead and put this on. It was a beige and navy blue baseball cap. It had something written on it but I don't know what. At first, it fell down over my eyes. I pushed it up some and tucked it behind my ears so it would stay. I couldn't tighten it. I resumed talking. I was talking about different kinds of window shades not about dreams. We were in Aunt P and Aunt H's house. Not their waking life house. It was very large and beautiful. They had in one area where I was standing to give the talk I could see five different windows. I was talking about how they had used different treatments and different fabrics on each window, I commented on how well coordinated it was and how good that combination went together. Then I reached in my box of stuff and pulled out some very small, maybe one inch in diameter fabric samples for vertical blinds. I asked if they had vertical blinds but just as I asked I saw that they did. They were kind of like a lacy flower pattern. Very pretty and I commented on the same. I asked them if she had help with the decorating or if she had done it all themselves. They said they had some help. Then we continued talking. Kendall B walked up to join the group and he took a seat. I introduced him, looked at him, said should I tell them now or later who you are. He just grinned and didn't say anything so I decided to wait until later. I was still feeling really uncomfortable, as though it wasn't going well. The TV was back on again and I was trying to get them to turn it off and leave it off. I whispered to Kendall B that I had some great things to show him about my research. He just grinned again and walked away to find a place to sit and observe my group. I was still feeling that it wasn't going well at all. I wasn't prepared. I was very ill at ease. I said I like to leave lots of time for questions because people have lots of questions. I started taking questions at that point. We were having some great discussion. We got off track from time to time talking about dreams. I realized from some of the questions that I was pretty well prepared so I felt less nervous about Kendall B hearing my answers to these questions.",dream group family aunt aunt aunt cousin woman st joe aunt family mother daddy house go school get thing finish put material together stuff go church realize must late many car park lot look watch say knew must minute late maybe someone meet outside take side door church end big meeting room paulette son also play video game stuff right behind say hop problem course say anything hand folder tv play realize keep get distract tv suppose conduct group keep find nothing stand watch tv suggest turn tv yet later realize thing happen know tv get turn back feel disorganize think fragment go well back outside go back inside time church look different big white church steep deep white cement step start walk eye really bother see become less stable foot alan walk open door walk hand bad eye walk slowly step carefully use one step wobbly see well enough take arm help find way bottom step step tell everyone go eye felt like get cold feeling go well really like say hope mind go go ahead put beige navy blue baseball cap something write know first fell eye push tuck behind ear would stay tighten resume talk talk different kind window shade dream aunt aunt house wake life house large beautiful one area stand give talk could see five different window talk use different treatment different fabric window comment well coordinate good combination go together reach box stuff pull small maybe one inch diameter fabric sample vertical blind ask vertical blind ask saw kind like lacy flower pattern pretty comment ask help decorate say help continue talk kendall walk join group take seat introduce look say tell later grin say anything decide wait later still feel really uncomfortable though go well tv back try get turn leave whisper kendall great thing show research grin walk away find place sit observe group still feel go well prepare ill ease say like leave lot time question people lot question start take question point great discussion get track time time talk dream realize question pretty well prepared felt less nervous kendall hear answer question,14.0343,13.685505,846,6,15,3,7,9,11,4,15,18,19,2
1628,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,241,2001-05-30,"I was at a hotel with family and friends but I'm not sure why. It might have had something to do with graduation. We were chatting with some people about Matthew graduating. He walked up and we were chatting a little bit. He knocked on somebody's room door and one of his friend's came out and his friend was trying to teach me to do this thing with my hands. Then they took off and Matthew came back and had picked up some mail for us at the front desk. It was a bunch of letters, a fed ex package, and a big box. None of them were for us. It wasn't the address of the hotel and it wasn't our name. I took them back down to the front desk to let them know that they were in our mailbox. They apologized and said they would take care of it. I told them the other box was still upstairs because it was sports equipment and it was too heavy for me to bring down. When I went back upstairs, it was sitting with some other things for them to take downstairs. As I was walking through the hotel, someone tapped me on the shoulder from behind. I turned around. It was two women and a man. The woman in the middle was tall, with glasses, blonde hair, and older. She reached down, hugged me, and gave me a kiss on the cheek. I didn't know who she was but I acted as though I did. I said, hi how are you? We chatted a little bit. Then the three of them went into the restrooms. I realized that they were from DDSI. I walked a little ways trying to find the DDSI meeting. I figured there must be a meeting there. I found it and I went in. There was a table at the front that Vince P, Joanne N, and probably the area coordinators were sitting there. I went up and just crouched down on the floor at the end of the table. Diane S was sitting at the end of the table. She said, since she had the baby she was just doing DDSI full time. She wasn't giving the small jobs to a decorator anymore. We talked about her husband a little bit. She had been sitting next to Vince P. I put my hand on his shoulder and pulled him towards me. I said you haven't been returning my phone calls. He said, yes, I know. I said what's going on with that. He said things are different now. I said what does that mean. He said the last message you left you were kind of coming on to me. I said, no I wasn't. He said, well things are different now. He wouldn't even talk to me any more than that. I finally decided that I was going to leave. I leaned over to Joanne N and asked her if there was anything she needed from WDF right now. She said not that she was aware of. I said, Okay. I can't stay because I'm not feeling well. However, I wanted to check in. Then one of the other coordinators stopped me before I left and opened a sample book to a fabric and asked me to find out if we have it in orchid and then she closed the book right away. I reached for a pad of paper and a pen. I had this little bitty pen, the size of my fingertip. I needed her to open the book back up so I could write down the fabric. I wrote down the page. As I was doing this, I realized that this was silly. Of course, it doesn't come in orchid. If it did, it would be in the sample book. I didn't say anything because I had already made her think I didn't know that already and that I was going to check on it. I wrote down the name of the sample book. I said that is just really beautiful fabric. It was shiny, satiny soft. Really nice fabric. She said, yes it is. Then two other people had some things for me so I wrote them down. Then I left and I realized I was barefoot. I don't know why. When I left, I was in a hall surrounded by doors. There was no way out except to go through one of these doors. I couldn't find the door that I just came through. I was looking in some of the doors and there were other meetings. I was trying to find my way out. I finally did, but I don't know how. As I was walking away, I ran into Tim W. He was saying something to me about still representing WDF. He said we have their business now, so we don't really need you. If I were you, I wouldn't do it. You aren't getting paid for it, and we have their business. He called me boy, or son, or something equally ridiculous. He shrugged his shoulders and walked away. At that point, I thought about not even turning in the notes I had. That wouldn't look good for me or for them. I also thought about what would happen down the road if I didn't do that. As I was walking through the hotel, there were many young women in beautiful white dresses. They were all alone. I wondered if there was a debutante ball going on. Then I saw a stage area where a lot of them were gathered. There were five of them performing but they were in pink dresses. I thought that's not a debutante ball, because they don't wear pink dresses.",hotel family friends sure might something graduation chat people matthew graduate walk chat little bit knock somebody room door one friend come friend try teach thing hand take matthew come back picked mail u front desk bunch letter feed ex package big box none u address hotel name take back front desk let know mailbox apologize say would take care tell box still upstairs sport equipment heavy bring go back upstairs sit thing take downstairs walk hotel someone tap shoulder behind turn around two woman man woman middle tall glass blonde hair old reach hug give kiss cheek know act though say hi chat little bit three go restroom realize ddsi walk little way try find ddsi meeting figure must meet found go table front vince joanne probably area coordinator sit go crouched floor end table diane sit end table say since baby ddsi full time give small job decorator anymore talk husband little bit sit next vince put hand shoulder pull towards say return phone call say yes know say go say thing different say mean say last message leave kind come say say well thing different even talk finally decide go leave lean joanne ask anything need wdf right say aware say okay stay feel well however want check one coordinator stop leave open sample book fabric ask find orchid close book right away reach pad paper pen little bitty pen size fingertip need open book back could write fabric write page realize silly course come orchid would sample book say anything already make think know already go check write name sample book say really beautiful fabric shiny satiny soft really nice fabric say yes two people thing write leave realize barefoot know leave hall surround door way except go one door find door come look door meeting try find way finally know walk away ran tim say something still represent wdf say business really need get pay business call boy son something equally ridiculous shrug shoulder walk away point think even turn note look good also think would happen road walk hotel many young woman beautiful white dress alone wonder debutante ball go saw stage area lot gather five perform pink dress think debutante ball wear pink dress,13.56927,13.491436,985,2,14,4,2,14,3,8,12,8,19,2
1629,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,242,2001-05-31,"Jennifer K came over. We were at mother and daddy's house. She came over to visit. She was telling me that her mother wanted to buy Matthew this huge toy for out in the yard. Toy for lack of a better thing to call it. I don't remember what she called it. It was going to be 24 x 12 feet, all plastic, enclosed, netting for safety. The kids could go in and jump in it and stuff. When mother was thinking about it, Jennifer K was in this tent thing that was zipped up and hanging from something in the house. I could tell mother wasn't pleased. I unzipped the thing that Jennifer K was in and she poked her head out. We talked about it a little bit more. I don't think Mother ever answered us. I don't remember Jennifer K leaving or anything. After she was gone, I was helping mother do some dishes. There was syrup all over the kitchen counter. Mother had walked away. I saw the syrup and I was starting to clean it up. She walked back so I stopped and went back to drying dishes. I told her that the syrup was there. She started rubbing a little bit. She got upset and stopped. I started again. I had put warm water on it and it had gotten hard like wax when it is cooling. I could peel it up very easily. I took those pieces and started peeling them up. She asked me how I knew to do that. I said that I just tried it. Something else about Jennifer K. We had placed something in the refrigerator, then we pulled it out laid it on the counter. I think that's where the syrup came from. After we finished the dishes, Bob F and I were standing in the kitchen. Mother came in and leaned her back against the counter. BJ came in. We knew that she was pregnant and she said she just wanted to ask us a question. She was thinking about getting an abortion. I said, how about if I invite this one priest, a family friend but not from the parish and not Father M, Father So and so to Matthew's party. Then you would have a chance to talk to him about it there. She said, oh, that would really be wonderful. I had a stuffed animal. One of the kids came out. I don't know if it was Rachel S or Bev as a little girl. I said Father so-and-so is coming to Matthew's party. She was excited. I said, so make sure you remember to bring him. Only I was talking about the stuffed animal, too. I was putting up Christmas lights on the outside of the house. It wasn't my birth home or my parent's house now. Then after I did that we all got bundled up, I don't remember everyone that was with us. I thought it was my Mother. It was Kay H and she was my Mother. We were going to a family Christmas party or something and we walked. Not all of the Christmas lights were working and I was kind of upset about that. I realized it was my fault because I didn't check all the bulbs before I put them up. I didn't even test them after I got done. I realized I had to go back out and work on them, fix them, the next day. As we were walking, we were crossing the street and there was something like a Christmas parade going on. It was dark outside. We went ahead and crossed the street just walking around some of the people marching in the parades and floats. They were almost like Disney characters or things that you would see in a cartoon. I can't make a good description at all. While I was walking around this, I was thinking, this is so cool. It's just like a dream. Then I said, it reminds me of that one other dream I had, with the Disney-like village. As we were walking there were also these kind of like booths, they were like little play houses. I walked up to the first one and they said, you can try to win a prize. They hand me this little cube, and they asked me a question. I had to show what kind of cube was the right answer to the question. I had to get all three questions right to win a prize. I got the first one wrong but they kind of cheated and gave me a clue and let me try again. Then I got it right and the next two right. For the prize they handed me a little film container with something in it. I didn't look to see what was in it. I was going to look at it later. I just stuck it in my purse. As I was walking, I saw that someone else had been playing something like a card game at one of the little houses. When I got to the house that person was done so I walked up and asked what she was doing. She had an option of a couple of different games. One game was like pictionary. One you could throw rings on a bottle. She said it was one dollar. I pulled out a five-dollar bill and then she said it's only 15 cents. I said, but you said it was a dollar. She said I'm trying to give you a deal. Just give me 15 cents. I didn't have 15 cents so I just gave her a dime. The game she brought me was like a puzzle where I looked at this vertical row of five things. Then she took it away and I had to pick up these pieces of the puzzle and put them in the same order. I didn't get it quite right. The second from the bottom thing was a cow but the cow on hers didn't look like any of the cows on mine. I told her that and so I said that wasn't fair. She said, just a minute let me give you your five dollars back. I don't remember her giving it back to me. They were closing for the night so we were rushing to get out of the way. They were rushing trying to lock up their little houses. I had someone else with me but I don't remember who it was. We ran because everyone else had gone ahead and I was kind of afraid we would get lost. Whoever was with me, I think it was an older Matthew, I asked him if he remembered how to get to grandma's house and he said he thought he did. We got there fine without any trouble. I don't remember being at grandma's house. When we were coming back, we were all driving separately. I got to this one place on the way back, there was kind of like a metal fence in a kind of fence. There was just a couple of inches of the fence sticking out of the ground and you had to drive over it into the maze, through this fence to the other side to get home. When I got in, I lost control of the car and I kept stomping on the brakes. It wouldn't stop. There were a bunch of other cars parked in there and I couldn't believe I didn't crash into any of them. I couldn't get control of the car and I couldn't get it to stop. Then it started turning back and sliding the other way, the way that I came from, and finally as I got to where I entered this place I was able to get control again and drive on out. I was the owner of the property. I could hear him yelling that someone was ruining his fence and he was going to get them. He was going to come out and I heard him yelling. Even as I was getting away, I heard him yelling that they got away but he was going to come after them. I got away. Then we were walking up the yard. Apparently, this was a very new house because there were huge piles of dirt and stuff out front. The outside of the house looked like plywood but there were full-grown evergreens too. We talked a little bit about that, something about the house and things that still needed to be done to finish the house.",jennifer come mother daddy house come visit tell mother want buy matthew huge toy yard toy lack well thing call remember call go foot plastic enclose net safety kid could go jump stuff mother think jennifer tent thing zip hang something house could tell mother pleased unzipped thing jennifer poke head talk little bit think mother ever answer u remember jennifer leave anything go help mother dish syrup kitchen counter mother walk away saw syrup start clean walk back stop go back dry dish tell syrup start rub little bit get upset stop start put warm water get hard like wax cooling could peel easily take piece start peel ask knew say try something else jennifer place something refrigerator pull lay counter think syrup come finish dish bob stand kitchen mother come lean back counter bj come knew pregnant say want ask u question think get abortion say invite one priest family friend parish father father matthew party would chance talk say oh would really wonderful stuffed animal one kid come know rachel bev little girl say father come matthew party excite say make sure remember bring talk stuff animal put christmas light outside house birth home parent house get bundle remember everyone u think mother kay mother go family christmas party something walk christmas light work kind upset realize fault check bulb put even test get realize go back work fix next day walk cross street something like christmas parade go dark outside go ahead cross street walk around people march parade float almost like disney character thing would see cartoon make good description walk around think cool like dream say remind one dream disney like village walking also kind like booth like little play house walk first one say try win prize hand little cube ask question show kind cube right answer question get three question right win prize get first one wrong kind cheat give clue let try get right next two right prize hand little film container something look see go look later stick purse walk saw someone else play something like card game one little house get house person walk ask option couple different game one game like pictionary one could throw ring bottle say one dollar pull five dollar bill say cent say say dollar say try give deal give cent cent give dime game bring like puzzle look vertical row five thing take away pick piece puzzle put order get quite right second bottom thing cow cow look like cow mine tell say fair say minute let give five dollar back remember give back close night rush get way rush try lock little house someone else remember ran everyone else go ahead kind afraid would get lose whoever think old matthew ask remember get grandma house say think get fine without trouble remember grandma house come back drive separately get one place way back kind like metal fence kind fence couple inch fence stick ground drive maze fence side get home get lose control car keep stomp brake stop bunch car park believe crash get control car get stop start turn back slide way way come finally get entered place able get control drive owner property could hear yell someone ruin fence go get go come heard yell even get away hear yell get away go come get away walk yard apparently new house huge pile dirt stuff front outside house look like plywood full grown evergreen talk little bit something house thing still need finish house,13.865347,13.611709,1472,3,11,5,6,14,10,9,17,15,27,2

1631,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,244,2001-06-01,"I was bike riding in this park with two other people but I don't know who they were. We decided to take this path. It was stone covered with these big, softball size, smooth stones. We took this path and it went down this hill, it was winding, curvy, and kind of. in waking life I would have taken it very slowly or even been leery of taking it at all. But I just; we just soared down this winding path of stones. We ended up at this place where they were taping a soap opera. I think it was, the one with Rick and Phillip in it -Guiding Light I think. We got down there and I said, look they're taping this show. But it was like there was this clear, barrier there but you couldn't see it, between where we were and where they were taping. There were different areas where they were taping different parts of the show. I asked someone if we could ask for autographs and they said no, not while they were working. So we walked through the different areas and saw the show. As we came back through we saw they were done and several of them were walking away. I was excited and I said, They aren't working now. Can we ask for autographs? They said yes. I ran up and asked for an autograph from the man who plays Rick. He was really nice. He gave me his autograph then put his arm around me and hugged me. Then he gave me a kiss on the check. He was joking around and then he kissed me lightly on the lips. He kept hugging me and so I hugged him back. Then he kissed me again on the lips. Then I also got an autograph from the man who plays Phillip. There was another one that I asked for an autograph but I don't remember who it was. , Rick and I fell in love. We decided we wanted to be together but there was some kind of, some people there that seemed to be from another country, maybe India. They had something like magical powers or potions. This one woman had this bowl of this stuff; it was pretty blue and enticing looking. She wanted Rick to taste it and she told him it was going to do something really good for him. I kept saying, No, Rick. Don't. Don't. I just had a sense that it was going to either change his feelings for me or change him in some bad way. He ended up not doing it. There was another bowl. This one was a different color. She was trying to entice him with this and trying to convince him that this one was different because it was a different color. I don't think he did. We were trying to get away. Rick and I and Phillip and I don't remember if there was anyone else with us or not. We still had our bikes, but now there was also this flat bed truck and we were trying to load some things on this flatbed truck to take with us. It was mattresses and some luggage. Some of us were still on our bikes. three of us. It seems that there was another woman with us too. We were riding trying to get away. The scenery kept changing like magically and becoming dangerous. We just kept riding through it and as it we did the scenery kept changing and because we kept going and didn't let it stop us it finally went back to normal. The next thing I know we were at an airport. Rick and I and Phillip and I don't remember if there was anyone else with us or not. We put all of our luggage on these conveyor belts. This one man was checking our luggage and he asked for our certificate. He found one in a piece of luggage. He checked it and it was okay. I realized there were several copies and only one copy was right. I told Rick There. That one in that luggage is the right one. We need to make sure we have our hands on it so nothing happens to it. So he grabbed that piece of luggage and tried to find it but he couldn't. We were running out of time and he finally grabbed it off the conveyor belt and tried to find it. While he was doing that I went ahead with Philip and Phillip was way ahead of me. And I said Oh yeah, I remember we talked about this in counseling. That he is like this and doesn't mean to be rude and it doesn't mean that he doesn't care or anything just because he is way ahead. not considering me being way behind. So I went ahead. The only other thing I remember is that it all worked out okay.

1633,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,246,2001-06-07,"I was at Margie D and Dennis D's house. It was a house in the country with a lot of land. I was walking up to the house with Margie D up this winding driveway. We had to duck under some of the trees occasionally. There were some flowering trees. It was hilly land. I remember that there was a lot of stuff out there but I don't remember what it was. We went in the house and I saw Dennis D. I commented that he was looking good. While I was standing there I was thinking about the fact that I had just heard that he had quit his job once to stay home with the kids. I remember when he kind of made a pass at me while they were dating and I was thinking about that too. I acknowledged the fact that it had been awhile since we had seen each other. Then two young children came out, Erin D and Dennis D Jr. Dennis D Jr. was being potty trained and was running around with no clothes on. I said something about Rachel S and her doing the same thing. Just joking around. There furniture was a eclectic, but from garage sales and stuff. The sofas and chairs were not all together. pieces on the floor. Samantha was laying in the back of a pick up truck and she was sucking on her finger. I was teasing her and I said, Yes, Miss College Graduate. She kind of grinned at me and said, Yes I need to work on breaking that habit don't I. Then I think Margie D came up. I spent the night there. I shared a bed with Margie D. The alarm was going off. I got up and was packing and getting ready to go. The alarm kept playing. I checked the alarm on my side of the bed and realized it wasn't mine. Finally, Margie D rolled over. I could tell she was getting ready to say something to me about the alarm, ask me to turn it off. I told her it wasn't mine.

1635,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,248,2001-06-11,"I was having my period. Twice I took a tampon out and put a new one in. I took one and wrapped it in a piece of paper no bigger than the tampon and pushed it together. I was in a car with Matthew and two other girls. Matthew was supposed to be taking one of them to the prom. He was in a black tux with a white shirt and white tie. I thought I really like that he decided to go with a white tie this year. Then I found out that the girls were sisters and they were both going with him to the prom. I was driving with the two girls and someone else in the car. I was driving from the back right passenger seat and was having trouble seeing. I was looking for a place to pull off so I could change places with the person in the front left so I could see better to drive. When I tried to pull off the road I was knocking over trashcans and stuff. Even after we made the change I was still. The place that I had to go forward and try to get out of there, there were all these trash cans and I kept running over them and knocking them down trying to get out of there. I also remember something about the road. It seemed to me that it was steep and very windy. the one girl, the one that Matthew was supposed to be taking to the prom, had some kind of psychological problems. I was supposed to be her psychologist and working with her and I said I couldn't work with her because she was gay and attracted to me.

1636,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,249,2001-06-16,"I was at a CRHP meeting with CRHP XIII. While at the meeting they asked me to give my witness. I was unprepared, did not have it with me, as they did not give me advance notice. Before I got up to do it one of the CRHP XIII women got up and started talking about her wedding coming up the next weekend. There was a child, hers maybe, running around the room. The woman had very dark, short hair and was dressed in a purple suit. I decided it was going to be awhile. I realized that I had forgotten to bring any of my things to do the Maori drawing. So I told Judy that I was going to run home and pick something up and that I would be back. Judy had something on her face. It looked like a knit fabric that fit very snug and covered all of her skin. I noticed two other women wearing similar things but different colors. I asked her what happened and she said she had her face exfoliated but had not yet completed the process. I left to go home. While trying to go home I took a wrong turn and got lost. I drove quite awhile, and was out in the country, before realizing what I had done. I thought I had just turned right instead of left or vice versa. So I pulled into a driveway to turn around. For some reason my car was stopped and I just sat there. There were two gentlemen standing by a barn talking. The older gentleman finally came up to the car. As he was approaching I started the engine again and rolled down the window. I told him I made a wrong turn and wanted to go to Indy. I pointed the direction that I thought I wanted to go and he nodded that he thought that was correct. I turned around and left. I hadn't driven very far until I ran into places along the road where there were huge stacks of packages of frozen fruits and vegetables in the road making it very difficult to get through. This concerned me because I didn't recall seeing them there the first time. I kept driving and came to a dead end. I didn't see how this was possible because I hadn't made any turns along the way either time. A couple of gentleman came out and were arguing about which way I should be going. A lady came out who recognized me. She was very friendly, like we were old friends. She was a black woman. I barely remembered her. I kept trying to remember where I had met her. I walked with her a little way and through her house and I was just blocks from where I wanted to be. She was telling me about this store that I had introduced her to for great deals on bed linens. I finally decided that I knew her from SVH. She worked at the front desk. Her name was Sue Ann Williams. She was a black woman, very friendly and kind. We went into the store and she was showing me different things. I realized how much I wanted to have an income again. As we were walking outside again, I told her I wanted her opinion on something I had just done. I told her that I had just moved out of an apartment that I love because of money. I went from a 3 BR with an upper deck and a large LR to a 2 bedroom with a small LR. The cost saving was $400. However, as I was talking to her I realized that I had not given my current owners one month notice so it was going to cost me an extra month rent there. I also realized that we had not moved anything off of the patio, upper deck or two downstairs closets. I had no idea how we were going to fit all of my things into this smaller apartment. Plus, I love this apartment and was miserable about moving into this new place that was smaller and white walls, etc. She wouldn't say much. She said it was time for her to go to bed. She climbed into a row of beds along the street. But they were my shoulder height and they were all attached to each other. Tonya H came up and climbed in next to her. I grabbed a blanket and covered Tonya. I exchanged some pleasantries with Tonya but don't remember what it was about. As I was walking away I was thinking that I would need to get help to move the rest of my things into the new apartment. Then I had the idea that I would just find help to move my things back into the old apartment. that I would find a way to be able to afford to stay there. I went into this retail store that had offered me a job making $41,500 a year but I had turned them down because it wasn't what I wanted to do. I walked into the store and the lady I had originally spoken with was standing there and asked me if I had made my decision as though I had not already turned her down. I verified the income and then said that I would like the job. There were several other employees standing around that didn't seem to like that I was coming to work there. One was trying to put up a good front at least. The manager was very happy and went to get the paperwork. I was trying to tell myself that it was going to be fine and at least it would relieve my financial burden and worries. I'm having difficulty figuring out where the actual apartment move came into this. But I distinctly remember us doing some of the moving. We were at the new apartment with boxes all around us. I walked into one room and BJ was disappointed because she was trying to have that whole room unpacked before I saw her. She was almost done. After she left I started moving things around because she had the things that I use the most in low hard to get at cabinets and things I seldom use in the easy-to-get-to cabinets.

1637,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,250,2001-06-16,"I was in my mother's hometown for business for a couple of days. Bev lived there and I went and visited her for a little while. I was feeling restless so I told her I was going to drive by Aunt P's and Aunt H's. It was 9:10 p.m. I said I bet they go to bed at 9 or 9:30 but that's okay. I'll just drive by and see if they are still up. If they are I might stop in for just a little bit. As I was driving there were these people outside and they had these big balloons, maybe 2-3 feet in diameter. There was a place that was roped off and the balloons were on string like maybe helium filled. I thought that maybe it was students doing some kind of a weather project. I went on over to their house and the lights were on. I saw them both sitting in the living room with their pajamas on. I stopped and knocked. Aunt H answered the door and was very surprised to see me. She thought that maybe something was wrong. I said, no I was just in my mother's hometown for a couple of days and I just stopped by to say hello because I saw you were still up. I sat and visited with them for a little bit and then left. As I was going back to my hotel, I guess, I stopped where these people were working with these balloons because there were more people there now. I asked them what they were doing. They were growing babies. There were all these babies born only with the head. They would take the heads and attach something that would grow a body. Then they put them in this balloon to allow the body to grow. They would float these heads in these balloons until the bodies grew.",mother hometown business couple day bev live go visited little feeling restless tell go drive aunt aunt say bet go bed okay drive see still might stop little bit drive people outside big balloon maybe foot diameter place rope balloon string like maybe helium fill think maybe student kind weather project go house light saw sit living room pajama stop knock aunt answer door surprise see think maybe something wrong say mother hometown couple day stop say hello saw still sit visited little bit leave go back hotel guess stop people work balloon people ask grow baby baby bear head would take head attach something would grow body put balloon allow body grow would float head balloon body grow,13.592002,13.595038,326,1,3,1,1,3,1,3,4,2,5,2
1638,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,251,2001-06-20,"At a theater, we were rehearsing a play that I had written. I had purchased all the costumes, jewelry and accessories for all the actors in this play. There were a lot of them. There were two main female characters that I kept calling the divas. They were Audrey T and Karen Mc. For them I had bought black skirts, black suit coats, and black shoes. But they were each different. Not exactly alike. There was some jewelry. There were earrings. kind of like faked gem earrings but they looked very nice. Maybe some bracelets. For the rest of the cast, their costumes were Native American and something. This is weird. There was something almost like a black robe. They were really heavy. There were these hats too, that looked more like Mexican. Really weird and ugly. Yet, the jewelry was Native American. But I had bought them each a watch with black band but they were all different. The hats and clothing looked the same. When we were done rehearsing they were all getting ready to leave. I said Oh wait! I have costumes for everyone. You can take these home with you. Someone was helping me spread it all out on the stage so they could take it home with them. I had all the jewelry in a bag. I dumped it out. It was all tangled up and I was trying to separate it out. Someone was trying to help me separate it out and put the earrings together and the necklaces together. There were bracelets and then the watches. I was trying to remember. I had the Diva's earrings in a separate bag. I was trying to remember if I bought watches for them or not. I don't remember. I don't remember how that worked out. The earrings were very pretty. I don't know why I thought it was Native American because it doesn't look Native American to me now. I don't know why I said that. There were some children too. So there were two separate piles of costumes. They didn't look Native American either. They weren't the black either. Someone picked one up. It was a jacket, not like a suit jacket, but it was loose fitting and colorful, like maybe orange or yellow. Someone said something about the people would. maybe I made an apology about the costumes. and someone said the audience would love it just like they would the play. And I thanked them for saying that about my play, that people would love it. Audrey T and Karen Mc came out with their jackets on but not the skirts. Audrey T said the skirt just didn't fit. I told her she could just wear some black slacks or something with it. So she started trying on shoes to decide which shoes she wanted. Then Karen Mc came out and said her skirt didn't fit either. She said she could only get it up to the bottom of her butt. She said maybe could wear something to cover the rest up. I said no, no, if you have a black skirt at home or black slacks, just wear that with it.",theater rehearse play write purchase costume jewelry accessory actor play lot two main female character keep call diva audrey karen mc buy black skirt black suit coat black shoe different exactly alike jewelry earring kind like fake gem earring look nice maybe bracelet rest cast costume native american something weird something almost like black robe really heavy hat look like mexican really weird ugly yet jewelry native american buy watch black band different hat clothing look rehearse get ready leave say oh wait costume everyone take home someone help spread stage could take home jewelry bag dump tangle try separate someone try help separate put earring together necklace together bracelet watch try remember diva earring separate bag try remember buy watch remember remember worked earring pretty know thought native american look native american know say child two separate pile costume look native american either black either someone pick one jacket like suit jacket loose fitting colorful like maybe orange yellow someone say something people would maybe make apology costume someone say audience would love like would play thank say play people would love audrey karen mc come jacket skirt audrey say skirt fit tell could wear black slack something start try shoe decide shoe want karen mc come say skirt fit either say could get bottom butt say maybe could wear something cover rest say black skirt home black slack wear,13.770313,13.801302,540,0,7,3,1,5,3,1,5,10,9,2
1639,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,252,2001-06-27,"I went to the Y to play racquetball with Matthew and a friend. I don't know who it was, just that it was someone I know. We were going to play doubles. The fourth was one of the employees of the Y - the young black man with a beard and Afro that is there quite often. We were assigned the last court. We went in and there were piles of boxes and shelves in the back right of the court. It left very little playing room. The Y employee wanted to play around it. I was upset and didn't see how that was possible, but we decided to try anyway. Then we didn't have racquets. We were trying to play with metal kitchen spatulas. Obviously, we kept missing the ball this way. I finally decided to go ask at the front desk if they had any racquets. The front desk area did not look like it does in waking life. There was an open area that we walked into. They were very busy. Several people behind the desk. which is unusual, and lots of customers on the outside of the desk. I asked for racquets and they handed us two. When we got back to the court we tried to use them but they weren't made for racquetball. One was more like a golf club. I finally went back to the desk and asked again. This time they were going through what they had trying to find what I was really looking for. They pulled a couple out that I told them were Ping-Pong paddles. We finally got two racquets. When I got back to the court I realized they were both bent. Half way up the racquet the rest of the racquet was bent towards me. This time when I went in I saw some other employees were clearing all of the mess out of the back corner. I thought that was good. Somewhere I saw Garnet P. She was there working. something to do with paint and crafts. She told me I had to complete my paint work. I stopped my racquetball to do what she said. I began mixing some paint and got some on the sleeve of my black cashmere winter coat. I was very upset and said I wasn't going to do this anymore and didn't know why I had to do it anyway. Someone said it was part of the class. I said I wasn't in the class. Garnet P tried to clean off my coat. I also had paint on the back of one of my favorite black heels. She tried to get it off of there too. These people who were painting were in the halls everywhere and making it very difficult to get around and to the courts. One woman sitting next to me was painting this mailbox, maybe on ceramic, as it had form to it. First she painted the whole thing a rust color. Then she painted what would have been the open space sky blue. She painted the mailbox yellow, the grass etc. green. I think there were also flowers. After everyone had finished the instructors were talking about people's work. They especially liked this woman's ability. She had also painted a picture of herself. Garnet P was just there as a representative of the paint company. They were also looking at two large collages that the group had made. Some of it was done with the tubes of glitter paint like I use. One woman drew something and they were teasing her about being a piehead. She was swimming, looked something like a turtle, and she had painted pictures of pies in front of and behind herself. I was walking around trying to find my shoes. I found them but in doing so stepped in some black paint. Then, I accidentally stepped on a piece of paper that appeared to be painted solid yellow. I was worried that I had ruined someone's painting. Then I noticed several other similar pieces, of different colors, that others had stepped on too, so I didn't worry about it anymore. I pointed to the stain on my shoe to Garnet P and asked her how to get the rest of the paint out. She hushed me and said just a minute. I made my way to the racquetball courts. I looked in each door trying to find the one that Matthew and the Y employee were in. When I found it, I went in just as they were going out a side door. There was another man sitting in there and I asked him and he pointed that they had just gone out that side door.

1640,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,253,2001-07-01,"Mother and BJ wanted me to have my annual check-up at a hospital other than SVH's. I went to satisfy them but was very upset the whole time. they wanted me to partially undress and have the rest of my exam in these area where passers-by could see me. I got very angry and decided to leave. I was hurrying around looking for my winter coat and handbag. They were saying things like I was overreacting and being silly. I just grabbed my things and left. very angry. As I left I saw, through a window accessible to all, a pregnant woman being examined. I went back to SVH's. I parked my car in a lot four blocks away. I was with someone but I don't know whom. There were several cement walls about waist high. It seemed to be in a bad part of town. The environment was not at all like SVH North Campus. not the surrounding area or the building itself. I went to the elevators to go to an office but I'm not sure where I was headed. It was a six-sided self-standing elevator. that is, not encased in a wall. The outside was all gold and very ornamental. I wanted to go to the 2nd floor. The elevator closed without me so I grabbed something on the outside and let it carry me up one floor like that. Meanwhile, other people were waiting on the first floor for the standard elevator. I'm not sure if I got where I was going. I was walking around and noticed there were a lot of people around. It now felt more like we were in a hotel lobby. I realized there was some kind of trade show or something going on. I decided to go check it out. While I was walking in I realized all of the vendors were just setting up. I was going to look for the WDF booth and thought that I should call someone and see if Marcia N could come and work the booth. As I was walking around I saw booths for people like CFC, only they had a different name now. I realized they had merged with another company and changed their name. Then I saw my own booth. I realized then that WDF did not have a booth and that I had forgotten I had signed up to do this. I went over to my booth space and the only thing there was a three-panel cardboard background that someone had placed there for me. It was very unprofessional and sloppy looking. It had two handmade signs that had been made by Jane Cr for one of my Happenings programs. They were cloud shaped and had been written using several colors of markers. I was thinking about what I would need to get set-up. The booth next to me was just the same, I think it was an insurance agent. I knew her. She was asking me what I typically do for these shows. I explained to her and then told her I was just on my way home to pick up materials before the show starts. My booth was in a corner. Don H was running the show. I told him I needed a table and tablecloth. He took a corner table piece and tablecloth from another booth. I grabbed an extra chair that didn't seem to be in use. The other vendor also had ice and soft drinks which I accidentally moved an ice cooler and a big bowl of ice to my booth. I went and returned them. When I came back someone else had placed cups of ice and 2-liter bottles of soft drinks at my booth. I realized whoever was sponsoring the event was placing them at all the vendors booths for the attendees. I was thinking about what literature to bring and how to make the most of this show. I thought I would offer a free mini interpretation for people and then have those names to add to my mailing list. I also realized that I might need to print and create some materials at home before I returned. I was aggravated for not being prepared already. Two people who were attending the show came to my booth before I could leave to get my materials. I talked to the two of them a bit. I told them I normally charge $50 for a dream interpretation but today, they could sign up to get a mini-interpretation done free if they signed up for the mailing list. The younger woman immediately wrote a check for $15. Apparently she misunderstood me. Her check was like a business check. I realized instead of giving the interpretations free at this show that I should sell them for $15. That way I would make some money for it and they would have more value for the show attendees because they had paid something for it. I was glad this had happened when it did to inform my decision. I was looking for something to write on to give her my name and address, as I didn't even have my business cards with me yet. The woman she was with, I think it was her mother, decided to have one done too. While they were doing that they had a little dog running around like crazy. I was trying to stop him so I could pet him. At times he would kind of jump up on me, on my leg because he was so small. He reminded me of Janet C dog that I called a rat dog. About the height and length of a cat, yet smaller body. Very short haired. He was dark brown and black. When I left to get my materials it was pouring down rain. I wondered why I hadn't brought my umbrella in with me. I bent over and was protecting my head with a paper. Along the way I realized that even though it was raining very hard, I didn't seem to be getting wet. I got to my car, went home and came back. Again I forgot my umbrella. When I got inside I realized I had only picked up one of quite a few things that I needed and that I needed to leave again. The woman in the booth next to me had changed our booths so she had the corner spot. I switched them back. When she came up she said something to me. I told her I paid for a corner booth because it is better exposure. I guess I must have walked away because when I came back she had taken over the corner again. This time she had moved in all of these big items for an elaborate display. I was sandwiched in between her and another large display. I now had one straight table and it was sitting sideways to fit in between the other two. You couldn't even see my display. I found Don H again and was very upset about this. I told him I wanted it fixed and wanted my corner back. He tried to explain to me why she needed the corner and that it had something to do with client privacy. I don't remember my response, but basically I wanted my corner back. I told him that he had about an hour to fix it. He said he couldn't believe I would say that. I explained that I simply meant I had to go home to get the rest of my materials so he had an hour to figure something out. The woman in the insurance booth was ignoring me now- obviously she didn't want to interact with me after what she had done. The man on the other side of me was trying to make me feel better about my space. I overheard Jane Cr and someone else saying that wasn't right what was happening to my space. They acknowledged that my service is very popular to people and that it deserved the right space. I left again to go home and get materials. It was still raining very hard and I wondered again why I had not remembered my umbrella. Again, even though I was simply holding a paper or something over my head I noted that while my body was not protected from the rain it was not getting wet. This time I couldn't find the lot where I parked my car. I went to it from the other side of the block but then the surroundings weren't familiar so I couldn't find it. I came across several businesses, some with overhangs where I could be protected from the rain for short periods of time. I think one was a hotel and two were fast food restaurants. I think one was KFC. I don't know what the other was. I was getting very frustrated because I couldn't find my car. I finally went to the other side of the block, thinking that I should be able to find it that way. I think I did find the right lot just before I woke up.",mother bj want annual check hospital svh go satisfy upset whole time want partially undress rest exam area passer could see get angry decide leave hurry around look winter coat handbag say thing like overreact silly grab thing leave angry leave saw window accessible pregnant woman examine go back svh park car lot four block away someone know several cement wall waist high seem bad part town environment like svh north campus surround area building go elevator go office sure head six side self stand elevator encase wall outside gold ornamental want go floor elevator close without grab something outside let carry one floor like meanwhile people wait first floor standard elevator sure get go walk around notice lot people around felt like hotel lobby realize kind trade show something go decide go check walk realize vendor set go look wdf booth think call someone see marcia could come work booth walk around saw booths people like cfc different name realize merge another company change name saw booth realize wdf booth forgotten sign go booth space thing three panel cardboard background someone place unprofessional sloppy look two handmade sign make jane cr one happen program cloud shape write use several color marker think would need get set booth next think insurance agent know ask typically show explain told way home pick material show start booth corner run show tell need table tablecloth take corner table piece tablecloth another booth grab extra chair seem use vendor also ice soft drink accidentally move ice cooler big bowl ice booth go return come back someone else place cup ice liter bottle soft drink booth realize whoever sponsor event place vendor booth attendee think literature bring make show think would offer free mini interpretation people names add mail list also realize might need print create material home return aggravate prepare already two people attend show come booth could leave get material talk two bit tell normally charge dream interpretation today could sign get mini interpretation free sign mail list young woman immediately write check apparently misunderstand check like business check realize instead give interpretation free show sell way would make money would value show attendee pay something glad happen inform decision look something write give name address even business card yet woman think mother decide one little dog run around like crazy try stop could pet time would kind jump leg small remind janet dog call rat dog height length cat yet small body short haired dark brown black leave get material pour rain wonder bring umbrella bent protect head paper along way realize even though rain hard seem get wet get car go home come back forget umbrella get inside realize pick one quite thing need need leave woman booth next change booth corner spot switch back come say something tell pay corner booth good exposure guess must walk away come back take corner time move big item elaborate display sandwich another large display one straight table sit sideways fit two even see display find upset tell want fix want corner back try explain need corner something client privacy remember response basically want corner back tell hour fix say believe would say explain simply meant go home get rest material hour figure something woman insurance booth ignore obviously want interact man side try make feel good space overhear jane cr someone else say right happen space acknowledge service popular people deserve right space leave go home get material still rain hard wonder remember umbrella even though simply hold paper something head note body protect rain get wet time find lot park car go side block surroundings familiar find come across several business overhang could protect rain short period time think one hotel two fast food restaurant think one kfc know get frustrate find car finally go side block think able find way think find right lot wake,13.860383,13.507295,1555,7,9,5,5,10,9,5,18,16,27,2

I was driving into or through a church parking lot and it was as though there were several weddings going on. There were many people and I saw several women dressed as brides. I was trying not to hit anyone as I drove through. The next thing I remember is that I was on roller blades and I was going around my mother's hometown High School. I don't remember now what I was looking for. I went around the back of the school and kept going into these woods. There was snow on the ground now and I kept roller-blading. I noticed prints in the snow and realized that there were wild animals around. At first I thought it was a wolf and then I noticed a white bear. I pulled some type of cord down from above and distracted the bear with that cord. He started chewing on it so I moved it in a direction that I could get away from him. I headed back where I came from. I passed another white bear but he didn't come after me. Now I was back at the school parking lot. I crossed the front of the school and went in to ask for directions to where I was going. Jennifer F was in there with some friends. I sat down with them. She told me she knew how to take blood pressures now. I told her she could practice on me. First she started feeling around on the side of my hand. I told her she had to find a nerve, and pointed one out on my inner wrist. This is odd because I would have been taking a pulse not a blood pressure. She cut a slit in the skin of the second finger on my right hand and slid her finger on the skin and pressed on a nerve to find it. I jerked my hand away and told her she was hurting me. She tried again and I did the same thing. I finally told her that she needs to do it on the outside of the skin not inside. I went back outside and headed somewhere else. I think I was headed to Aunt H's again. I got lost and asked someone for directions to Dair Ave. Somewhere along the way Bev joined me. We were laughing about how well we were roller-blading. I was able to jump up on sidewalks and jump from sidewalk to sidewalk across driveways. I counted eleven in a row once that I jumped. We were standing and talking to someone about not having learned how to stop yet we were both stopped and I was trying to figure out how to explain that.

1643,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,256,2001-07-08,"I had a dream group meeting. There were nine people there. Louise H, Sophia K, Dan M, Lou S, the others I don't remember. Mark M was not there. I was getting very sleepy towards the end of the meeting. Our discussion got way off track. I said something about this being a very interesting conversation. It could go on for hours, especially when you talk about multiple personalities and the fact that if they have MP do they also have multiple souls and multiple spirits or some combination. I was having a very hard time keeping my eyes open while I was saying that. After the meeting was over I thought everyone was gone and I went to pick up the money. I thought there would be $90 but there was only $3. I was very upset and realized I didn't say anything about them leaving their money before they left so it was my fault. Still, I was disappointed that not even Lou S, Dan M and Sophia K left their money. Surely if they had left theirs, the others would have done likewise, and those three know the routine by now.

I thought that brush would work fine since they were just puppies and very small. Their hair was matted, kind of like an old stuffed animal. After I brushed them, their hair was silky, soft, just like Belle's. Someone said all the puppies hadn't had their shots so we couldn't give them away yet. That was when I realized that I had already given three away. I realized we could get the two back to get them their shots but we couldn't get the other one back from Kidwell's.",matthew live mother daddy belle puppy give one puppy uncle aunt give tow someone else remember still four puppy play caramel color puppy realize long time since bath decide get sir gallahad brush brush think brush would work fine since puppy small hair mat kind like old stuffed animal brush hair silky soft like belle someone say puppy shot give away yet realize already give three away realize could get two back get shot get one back kidwell,13.714122,13.58043,170,0,5,0,0,2,1,0,5,2,6,2
1646,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,259,2001-07-21,"I went to church. When I went up to receive the Blood of Christ, the Eucharistic Minister was trying to use a new phrase and she couldn't remember it. She was mumbling and kind of being flippant. Finally she just said, oh well, The Blood of Christ and then just continued using that phrase. I was standing in back when church let out and I was trying to push my way through the crowds to get to someone (or something) quickly. before I missed them or it. Matthew and I are in the car. He is driving. We were behind some buildings and he was going to park right behind a bunch of emergency vehicles. fire engines and ambulances. I told him he couldn't park there but that he could park anywhere else along the building. We never did park. The next thing I saw were people going through kind of a drive-thru window for something but it wasn't a restaurant. I told Matthew to drive around them and leave. As we were getting ready to leave we saw a young black man giving someone in another car something that looked like aspirin from this giant bottle. He approached our car. I was curious so I told Matthew to stop. He gave us two and it turned out they were batteries that looked like aspirin. He gave us a bottle of them. the size of a regular aspirin bottle. As we left I was telling Matthew what an ingenious marketing idea that was. Now I'm driving, and really fast because Matthew was going to be late for work and he had to get home to change before going to work. I sped through a yellow light. I accidentally drove through a red light. As soon as I realized what I did and ran three more in a row. I couldn't seem to help it. I was finally able to stop the car, a screeching stop, for the last one. At that time I realized there was a police car ahead of me, but he didn't do anything. We're at the church office. There were three desks sitting in the lobby. I thought it was odd the way they were set up because two of them, the two in front, had their backs to the door and where people would come in. Matthew and I had gone into the back of the church and brought some things into the office. Matthew was sitting at one of the desks typing something that he needed to leave there. It was due or overdue. Just as he thought it was done he realized he had typed it in all caps so he had to retype it. While he was doing that Julie O came out and I commented about the desks- that she had gotten that beautiful new desk unit and now they took it away and put these desks there. I didn't tell her what I thought of the two that had their backs to the door. She made some comment to say that this was a good thing. Of course she would, whether she really thought so or not. That would be the nice Christian thing to do. I was giving two other women that came out the other things that I had carried into the office from the back of church. The paper bag had things in it that people had been making in the back of church. They reminded me of valentine things but were very large, made out of large colored paper. I said I didn't know what they were but that they kind of looked like Valentine things. They were puzzled by that but then mentioned something about Alice S and I said, yes, she would be working on that about now. So they took the bag. After they took it I found some others lying on the floor. I picked them up and placed them on one of the desks. One of the things is my little cedar chest that normally sits on my dresser. It was full of pictures. The pictures on the bottom were of Matthew and I. At first I told them I wasn't sure what it was and when I saw the pictures of Matthew and I on the bottom I said, Oh, now I know. Someone saw my chest sitting here with these pictures so they just put their own on top. They agreed that made sense. We saw a few of the pictures that had been added. The people were naked, some had body paint, but you couldn't see any genitals or any of the women's breasts. They took the chest and I told them that, of course, I would want the chest back. They said of course, but they didn't bring it back. As Matthew was finishing his typing I asked if I could take the chest back with me now and someone went to get it.",go church go receive blood christ eucharistic minister try use new phrase remember mumble kind flippant finally say oh well blood christ continue use phrase stand back church let try push way crowd get someone something quickly miss matthew car drive behind building go park right behind bunch emergency vehicle fire engine ambulance tell park could park anywhere else along build never park next thing saw people go kind drive thru window something restaurant tell matthew drive around leave get ready leave saw young black man give someone another car something look like aspirin giant bottle approach car curious tell matthew stop give u two turn battery look like aspirin give u bottle size regular aspirin bottle leave tell matthew ingenious marketing idea drive really fast matthew go late work get home change go work speed yellow light accidentally drive red light soon realize ran three row seem help finally able stop car screech stop last one time realize police car ahead anything church office three desk sit lobby think odd way set two two front back door people would come matthew go back church bring thing office matthew sit one desk type something need leave due overdue think realize type cap retype julie come comment desk get beautiful new desk unit take away put desk tell think two back door make comment say good thing course would whether really think would nice christian thing give two woman come thing carry office back church paper bag thing people make back church remind valentine thing large make large colored paper say know kind look like valentine thing puzzle mention something alice say yes would work take bag take find others lie floor pick place one desks one thing little cedar chest normally sit dresser full picture picture bottom matthew first tell sure saw picture matthew bottom say oh know someone saw chest sit picture put top agree make sense saw picture add people naked body paint see genitals woman breast take chest told course would want chest back say course bring back matthew finish type ask could take chest back someone go get,13.723147,13.530788,841,2,9,2,5,7,6,7,8,8,18,2
1647,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,260,2001-07-22,"I had just secured a job working here locally for NASA. Our quadrant was in the middle of a crisis. NASA had commercial airliners and one of the pilots had crashed a plane intentionally. At first they did not realize that he had survived until a subsequent incident. Two pilots, a husband and wife, were sent on a mission to try to stop the criminal pilot. The husband was Anthony Edwards, actor. I walked/ran with them through many of the checkpoints/security clearance points to get them securely into their aircraft. I was in training. I was trying to get security clearance and the equipment was not taking my SS number. I realized that someone had entered a 0 before the number and that was causing the malfunction. No one knew who had done it so we suspected the criminal pilot. I was the first to realize the criminal pilot had survived when I saw him reappear, almost as though it was a scene in a movie. He came up from the ground in a very surreal/ghostly manner. In another scene I was having anxiety about accepting a position with NASA. I wasn't at all sure I was up to the task. I kept telling myself that I had to give myself time to learn the ropes and I had to maintain my confidence. I met a woman who had not been working there very long. She had names in blocks on a clipboard and some were scratched out. I realized that she was fairly new, not as new as me, learning and making mistakes also. I found that very reassuring. I went to my station, standing at a piece of computerized equipment. I remembered that Raina D worked for NASA and decided to call her and let her know that I was working there. We spoke for a little bit on the phone. After getting off the phone I knew she would tell Barry C about this and that might change his mind a little about me. I decided to go to lunch. I went and changed into shorts and sandals so I could exercise on my lunch break. Raina D showed up at my station and warned me. She asked me if it was okay to take my lunch break now. She told me they are very particular about things like this. There was a gentleman working at a station right next to me that she knew. I had not been introduced to him yet. She introduced us and told me that he is a great source of information and I should ask him any questions I have. As she was telling me this I was slipping on the sandals. I saw on other people going to lunch and I saw Raina D, in particular, meeting someone for lunch. I asked the gentleman about lunchtime, length, and the appropriateness of using that time for exercise.",secure job work locally nasa quadrant middle crisis nasa commercial airliner one pilot crash plane intentionally first realize survived subsequent incident two pilot husband wife send mission try stop criminal pilot husband anthony edward actor walk run many checkpoint security clearance point get securely aircraft train try get security clearance equipment take ss number realize someone enter number cause malfunction one knew suspect criminal pilot first realize criminal pilot survive saw reappear almost though scene movie come ground surreal ghostly manner another scene anxiety accept position nasa sure task keep tell give time learn rope maintain confidence meet woman work long names block clipboard scratch realize fairly new new learn make mistake also find reassure go station stand piece computerized equipment remember raina work nasa decide call let know work spoke little bit phone get phone know would tell barry might change mind little decided go lunch go change short sandal could exercise lunch break raina show station warn ask okay take lunch break tell particular thing like gentleman work station right next knew introduce yet introduce u tell great source information ask question tell slip sandal saw people go lunch saw raina particular meeting someone lunch ask gentleman lunchtime length appropriateness use time exercise,13.983262,13.461895,490,2,4,1,6,2,1,4,7,5,13,2
1648,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,261,2001-07-22,"I was working for this man in a store in the mall. I'm not sure what kind of store it was. maybe a pet store. The only animals that were there were a whale, a cow, and a goat. and later a calf. The store was a very contemporary decor with deep vivid colors. One color in particular that I remember is purple. There were also a few very long steps leading up to a main open area. That was the majority of the room. The only thing I remember being in here though was a large aquarium tank holding the whale. The whale was not the same size as it would be in waking life. It was approximately 5 feet long and its diameter was slightly smaller than my own. I was very concerned about the whale. I kept adding water to the tank and the whale kept getting out and I kept putting it back in. I had put the whale is something similar to a pillowcase because I thought that would be better for it. Later the owner told me that the whale was dying and there was nothing we could do to save it so I took it out of the pillowcase. The whale just lay in the water from that point on. We realized that the goat and cow had gotten loose and gone out into the mall. There was another young woman and a young man that worked there. The goat came right back but the young woman and I were going out into the mall to look for the cow. There was another woman there, I believe she was the lover of the storeowner. She was going to go to the left in the mall looking for the cow and the other girl and I were going to the right. Before the two of us left, however, I suggested we call mall security and see if anyone had called a reported the cow on the loose. I have a sense that I didn't like the owner's lover very much so I didn't care if she was out searching the mall needlessly. We did get the cow back from security. Then we realized that there was a calf missing so the female employee I was with was going out into the mall in the other direction and search for the calf. There had been some joking around about me going to bed with the owner. I was teasing him that he had never been with anyone like me, no one else would measure up after, etc. He had an apartment above the store. I went up there once and saw him in bed with the other female employee. I don't know how I knew it but he was one to sleep with a lot of different woman for no reason other than sex. The cow was dying also so we let the cow and whale lay together to comfort each other until they died. I went upstairs to talk to the owner about the animals dying. I was very sad and saw that he was too. We were especially sad that the whale was dying. I asked if there was anything I could do for him. He said he would just like me to lay and cuddle with him to give him comfort. I thought that would give me comfort as well so I agreed. But things progressed as he teased me a little bit. Unfortunately, it didn't stop there and we ended up making love. But it really was that, not just having sex. It was incredible. He had undressed and then I undressed while he watched. I was wearing black lingerie. The one female employee came up and saw us in bed together and was very upset. He called me later and told me he was done with other women. That he was very surprised because he had given up hope of finding his soulmate but he knew he had found that in me. I felt the same way. The other female employee and the male employee were both upset when they learned that we had made love. The male employee was jealous and hurt that I chose the owner instead of him. The owner and I ended up getting married. I came downstairs. We closed the store and locked the door. Someone was knocking at the door and I couldn't see who it was. So I put the chain on so I could open it safely and see who it was. It was something about the goat or the calf. We decided to change the store, I think into a restaurant. The next time I went upstairs to the apartment he had completed remodeled it. It was fairly contemporary in decor. probably not what I would choose in waking life. but I loved it in the dream. The floors were all hardwood. It was one huge open space. The bedroom was upstairs in an open loft area with a winding staircase leading up to it. There were several area rugs on the floor. I was looking for the stereo. I wanted to put some music on so we could dance. A doctor came to the apartment because I was having some type of physical problem. I was observing the doctor my husband and myself. I was talking about how I looked. re: the medical problem. The doctor had me bend over towards my toes and she was looking at my face. My husband came down from the bedroom are. We were talking a little about money. It had something to do with a $1,000. He said, It's no big deal.

1649,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,262,2001-07-25,"I moved back into the house on Lakeland Drive. With Darren but not to share a bedroom. I was thinking very intentionally about this. Even though we were going to be sharing this house I certainly wasn't going to share my bed. I did think, momentarily, about reconciliation, and thought immediately. Oh, NO! NO WAY! Then I wondered why such a thought would even occur to me because it just repulses me to consider that. We bought it from Margie D and Dennis D, initially. They said they were moving and I said, maybe I should buy it from you. After I moved in it seems that there was someone else involved. I noticed that the paint in some of the rooms was still the same color as when I had owned it previously. There was a listing in the paper for the house and it said two bedrooms and a loft. I laughed that they called the third bedroom a loft because it was no different than the other two rooms. It was a one-story house. In the one room, all the walls were kind of like sponge painted. I looked up and they had done the ceiling too. I realized they had done it to look like clouds. I thought maybe I could leave the ceiling like that. Then I noticed that on the ceiling they had used stuffed animals. One of the stuffed animals was a Teddy Bear. On the walls they had made the white parts look like butterflies. In one room they had a big splotch of paint. In one room there was a framed picture attached to the middle of the ceiling. In another room there were two things attached to the ceiling, not necessarily in the middle and not aligned but a seemingly random placement. They were abstract in design but after studying them I realized they said LE1. I didn't know what this was and then someone brought a bottle of men's cologne in. It was called LE1. A man sprayed it all over himself and we still couldn't smell it. I said I hadn't heard of it before. Audrey T and Karen Mc were there. Audrey T had done something and she was embarrassed. I hugged her head and kissed her on the head and told her I loved her. The third room I was making my office. It's like I was sharing it with Karen Mc. There were several windows in that room. I was excited to get that room just the way I wanted it. It was spacious. not like in waking life. Someone had moved all the furniture in without me guiding them. I was anxious to begin moving the furniture around. I told Karen Mc and someone else how I was going to set up my desk and credenza by the window. But I was going to set up the desk so it was coming out from the wall into the center of the room. Probably have my computer facing the window. Karen Mc said she figured I would do that and since it was my house she couldn't really say anything. I said, well, maybe we can have your sewing machine by the other window.",move back house lakeland drive darren share bedroom think intentionally even though go share house certainly go share bed think momentarily reconciliation think immediately oh way wonder think would even occur repulse consider buy margie dennis initially say move say maybe buy move seem someone else involve noticed paint room still color previously list paper house say two bedroom loft laugh call third bedroom loft different two room one story house one room wall kind like sponge paint look ceiling realize look like cloud think maybe could leave ceiling like notice ceiling use stuff animal one stuffed animal teddy bear wall make white part look like butterfly one room big splotch paint one room frame picture attach middle ceiling another room two thing attach ceiling necessarily middle align seemingly random placement abstract design study realize say know someone bring bottle men cologne call man spray still smell say heard audrey karen mc audrey something embarrass hug head kiss head tell love third room make office like share karen mc several window room excite get room way want spacious like wake life someone move furniture without guide anxious begin move furniture around tell karen mc someone else go set desk credenza window go set desk come wall center room probably computer face window karen mc say figure would since house really say anything say well maybe sew machine window,13.588016,13.655932,547,2,8,1,2,5,1,2,7,5,8,2
1650,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,263,2001-07-25,"I was trying to track down Vince P. I somehow knew about a DDSI meeting. I drove part of the way but then I was walking through this office complex. several different office buildings. I found the DDSI meeting. I was sitting at a round table with 8-9 people. Jeannette T and Marcia N were there. I thought, oh, they do both still work for WDF. I recalled that I had thought about contacting Marcia N for a job before but now see that she is still happily working for WDF. I also noticed that they did not present themselves as they used to. They used to be very particular about their appearance regarding make-up, hair and clothing. At this meeting they appeared somewhat unkempt; no make-up and their hair kind of messy. Marlene F was there. I was surprised that she was there. I decided that she had perhaps bought a franchise in FWI. Later, at the meeting I think, they were doing something and talking about something in a treasure chest. Vince P and someone else wheeled in this very large gold square box that was supposed to be a treasure chest. Vince P was pulling it into the room by a rope. It was about 4 feet high and 4 feet square. Now it seemed as though I was sitting with Patti C and the treasure chest is small and sitting on the table in front of us. We are looking at the contents. It is all bags of candy. We realized that each kind of candy represented a different award so we were counting each kind of candy to determine how many of each award there was. The only kind I remember is Jelly Beans and that was the one there was the most of. One of the franchise owners was standing up talking to Vince P and Joanne N. I think they were recognizing what they had done for the franchise owners. She was pulling out these little toy figures, about two inches tall. They had been buried under the bags of candy. Each different figure under a separate kind of candy. When I realized this I tried to put the candy back exactly how I had found it. I went into the DDSI office and was looking for people I know, just to say hello. I realized that Joanne N was the only one there that I knew, but I decided to go ahead and say hello. I walked into this office building lobby and there were these three unusual people. I don't know how to describe them. It was an older couple, that resembled gnomes, but they were the size of normal people. Their cart was being pulled by a man-like animal. I have no idea how to describe that better.",try track vince somehow know ddsi meeting drive part way walk office complex several different office building find ddsi meet sit round table people jeannette marcia thought oh still work wdf recall think contact marcia job see still happily work wdf also notice present use use particular appearance regard make hair clothing meeting appear somewhat unkempt make hair kind messy marlene surprise decide perhaps buy franchise fwi later meet think something talk something treasure chest vince someone else wheel large gold square box suppose treasure chest vince pull room rope foot high foot square seem though sit patti treasure chest small sit table front u look content bag candy realize kind candy represent different award count kind candy determine many award kind remember jelly bean one one franchise owner stand talk vince joanne think recognize franchise owner pull little toy figure two inch tall bury bag candy different figure separate kind candy realize try put candy back exactly find go ddsi office look people know say hello realize joanne one knew decide go ahead say hello walk office building lobby three unusual people know describe old couple resemble gnome size normal people cart pulled man like animal idea describe well,13.448329,13.318864,473,0,5,1,1,6,2,3,5,3,13,2
1651,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,264,2001-07-25,"I was using a cardboard box as a car, driving through BR. People were driving on an area between the buildings and the sidewalk. It was very narrow and in waking life a car could certainly not fit on it. It kept getting more and more narrow. I thought that it was easier for my box/car than it was for people in normal cars. I got out and kind of folded the box up and continued because it became so narrow. I then realized that I was walking head on into cars coming from the other direction. So I turned around quickly and headed back the other way. I decided to go around the other side of these businesses to get where I was going. I'm not sure how it happened but my box/car got soaking wet and I was afraid it was going to fall apart. It brushed up against my bare leg. It left a dirty spot that I wiped off after pulling the box further away from me. I got to the restaurant where I was meeting someone. I unfolded it and set it up and then entered the restaurant for lunch. When I came back out it wasn't raining anymore. But I was concerned that my box/car was sturdy enough to transport both of us since it had gotten all wet. However, it now looked more like a car but not a regular car or even a convertible. But there was a portion that resembled the front seat of a car. It was very sturdy. The person with me, a woman, said it had dried out some and was good and sturdy and would be fine.",use cardboard box car drive br people drive area building sidewalk narrow wake life car could certainly fit keep get narrow think easy box car people normal car get kind fold box continue become narrow realize walk head car come direction turn around quickly head back way decide go around side business get go sure happen box car get soak wet afraid go fall apart brush bare leg leave dirty spot wipe pull box away get restaurant meeting someone unfold set enter restaurant lunch come back rain anymore concern box car sturdy enough transport u since gotten wet however look like car regular car even convertible portion resemble front seat car sturdy person woman say dry good sturdy would fine,14.0245495,13.325886,285,0,3,1,2,2,2,1,2,3,3,2
1652,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,265,2001-07-27,"I had been on the phone with Doctor Pf's office. He had gotten a call from a patient who was insisting he do surgery and Doctor Pf said he wasn't a surgeon and he didn't agree with the decision to have the surgery anyway. But he said if he was going to do the surgery he had to have someone assisting him. The surgery was going to be on a little boy and the mother was being very adamant because without surgery the child could die. So I had called Doctor C to see if he would do it. It was 4:30 am when I called and he was very pleasant to talk to for that time of morning and for receiving a call at home. He said no problem. He found out from me who the patient was and where to go and then said he would be there. Later I drove to his house and I was going to spend the night there, but it was later that morning. I got there just as he was getting ready to leave. We chatted very briefly and then he kissed me on the lips and left. I was quite surprised by that, that he did that. I stayed at the house while he left to go do this surgery. I heard Sara C coming so I grabbed a blanket and lay down on the floor behind the sofa and pretended to be asleep. The sofa didn't sit next to a wall. She knelt on the sofa and looked over and saw me lying there. She said something to me and I pretended to be half-asleep. I said I was laying here reading and I fell asleep so I just stayed here. She insisted that I get up and lay on the sofa. She was on her way out. I watched her leave and was thinking that Sara C just didn't seem like the type of woman Doctor C would be married to. They appeared to be an odd couple. Although, Sara C in the dream did not look at all like Sara C in waking life. After Sara C left the boys came down, they were maybe 5-7 years younger than in waking life. It was Jeff C and Ben C although Ben C said that was not his name. I don't remember now what he said it was. It was about time for me to get up already and I had just gotten to sleep. The boys stayed there and wanted to talk and play. So I did. I talked to them and gave them a lot of attention. I realized then that I had to get ready and get to work. I had seen a shower on wheels at the bottom of the driveway. I went out and pushed it to the top of the driveway and it rolled off the edge of the driveway and into the grass. I thought that was probably too far so I pulled it back out of the grass. I was trying to figure out a way to use it so no one would see me naked. It looked like a bathtub with two walls on the ends but nothing on either side. The walls on the ends were not very wide and got narrower towards the top. I realized if I turned it one way the neighbors would see me and if I turned it the other way the cars driving by would see me. I realized that I didn't bring my shampoo and stuff with me so I was going to go back in the house to get it. At that point I saw the shower wasn't even in Doctor C's driveway but in someone else's. So I walked back into the house and I asked someone which shower I should use. They said they didn't have a shower in the house. They said there was supposed to be one in one room but Doctor C made it into his poolroom and so there wasn't one in there I could use. I really wanted to take a shower and get cleaned up before I went to work. I asked someone if I could see the house. There were quite a few people around and they weren't sure if they should let me see the house. I said I was sure it was okay because I worked for Doctor C and he and I had a very good relationship and he had invited me to see the house previously and I hadn't been able to make it. They finally agreed. This house was just incredible. Much of it had an almost sci-fi appearance to it. Contemporary! Cool! Unusual! Yet some rooms were fairly traditional. There is no way I can come close to describing this accurately. The office was fairly traditional. Very large room with lots of dark wood. Very masculine in appearance. Then we started to go into this other room. It was as if the walls had different levels to them, almost like upside down stair steps. But they kept moving. As you tried to enter an area the wall would come down and block you. I tried to get down and crawl under but didn't make it that way either. Someone said you had to push a button to stop them so you could get in. This was Doctor C's own private room and he did that so that other people couldn't get in. I finally found one of the buttons and pushed it and then saw a red door. So I held the button while I got as close to the door as I could and then made a dash for the door. I got through. I don't even remember now what was in this room. We were going from one room to another and we had to get in this monorail type of transport. The house looked like it was a city block in size and it seemed to be located in an area similar to Las Vegas. A lot of neon lights. As we were riding we were outdoors and I could see his house was hidden by lots of trees and greenery. We were going up to the 7th floor and there was a section of wall that was octagon shaped. On each section of the octagon was an elevator door and the octagon was going around in a circle. So you had to try to push the button while it was going around. I finally did. Several of the other people got in the elevator and I couldn't get in quick enough, so myself and another person got in another one that opened. Someone said room 7 to get the elevator to take us where we wanted to go instead of pushing a button on the inside. The elevator itself was shaped kind of like a space module that astronauts return to earth in. And it didn't go up and down but it went sideways and at angles. At another point we were in, maybe his playroom. He was there and not dressed at all like he would normally dress. He kissed me again and this time it was more passionate. He started to pull my blouse up and I stopped him and said no we can't do that. Things still progressed a bit. We did end up making love. Then all of a sudden I wasn't with him again and we were looking at some other rooms in the house. The ninth floor I believe. There was a big open area of marble floor and marble steps, green I think. It was a huge area and I thought this is just such a huge house. The steps here were a half circle, very wide, and fairly tall. I thought, no wonder it takes him so long to answer the door or to go from one room to another. I remember going up the steps but I don't remember where they led. There was another place in the house similar to that. I was spending time with his boys and we were playing and laughing and having a good time. They were really enjoying being with me and the attention. It was time for me to go and I wanted to hurry and leave before Doctor C saw me. So the boys were trying to help me get my things together and out to the car.

1653,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,266,2001-07-27,"I woke up, in the dream, not from the dream - and got out of bed and went into the hall and noticed that Matthew's room was full of people, wall-to-wall. They were in there to watch a PHS event from the window. PHS was right across the street. Their practice football field was right outside our window. They were watching the band practice. The band was in uniform. Apparently maintenance had left my front door open so people were just coming in and sitting in Matthew's room watching the band practice. I thought, How dare they just come in here and do this. A little girl wanted something to drink. I didn't want to encourage this so I decided to take her across the street to get a drink of water. It was like we lived on a city street. She didn't like it that I did that. She was about 3 years old. I brought her back to her mother and went downstairs to the kitchen and these two young girls came in and asked if they could have some more of my chocolate chip ice cream. They were already eating some. They had taken it and put it on cookies. I thought, how dare they just help themselves to the food in my kitchen, too. I just thought that the next time I am just going to have to make sure that my door stays shut and locked so people can't come in like that. I was talking to some woman. I think she was a sister. We were talking about some place that I wanted to get a job. I said, well, it's on the same block as PHS. She acted like she either didn't know what I was talking about or didn't believe me. So I pointed out through the window. PHS looked like a city school. It was a several story, red brick building. I pointed just past it, a couple of buildings down. I said see it's that one. She said oh yes. I said, see, it's in the same block as PHS. She said yes, yes. Later she was packing all of her things and telling me that she just took a new job there. I thought, Well. How strange is that? I just got done telling her that I was trying to get a job there and now she is telling me that she has a job there. I wondered if it was the same job or maybe it would work in my benefit. Since I knew her maybe she could help me get that job.",woke dream dream get bed go hall notice matthew room full people wall wall watch ph event window ph right across street practice football field right outside window watch band practice band uniform apparently maintenance leave front door open people come sit matthew room watch band practice think dare come little girl want something drink want encourage decide take across street get drink water like live city street like year old bring back mother go downstairs kitchen two young girl come ask could chocolate chip ice cream already eat take put cooky think dare help food kitchen think next time go make sure door stay shut lock people come like talk woman think sister talk place want get job say well block ph act like either know talk believe point window ph look like city school several story red brick building point past couple building say see one say oh yes say see block ph say yes yes later pack thing tell take new job think well strange get tell try get job tell job wonder job maybe would work benefit since knew maybe could help get job,13.678836,13.710304,446,0,10,0,1,7,1,2,7,1,12,2
1654,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,267,2001-08-02,"I was with the cast from friends. We found an old, abandoned boat, kind of like a cabin cruiser, and climbed on board and checked it out. I found all these compartments. It looked like solid wood blocks but sections would swing open and reveal compartments. They were all attached though. I don't know how to better describe that. Joey fixed the engine so it would run again. We started running it down this lake. We met some men that paid us to transport some things up and down the river for them. They stayed on board with us. Monica was the chef. She was baking different types of muffins. I ate one before I realized she didn't want us to. She said something about the vanilla ____ ones. That is the kind I was eating. It was chocolate on the bottom, vanilla on top and then some type of special icing. Some of realized that the men that we brought on board were drug dealers and they had us transporting drugs for them. Monica was the last one we told about this.

1655,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,268,2001-08-03,I went to Len U's funeral. He was a member of BPE. he was a gentleman who attended the Mensa meeting also and had sent me an email about networking for jobs. This makes me think that it wasn't Len U at all but rather another man that I had met at Mensa and BPE and as described here. When we were at the funeral home I saw his wife and maybe a daughter. When I saw him in his casket I didn't think it really looked like him. We were getting in line to view the body. As we were walking to get in line there were other people laid out in their caskets as well. There was something about after the wake gathering for a meal.,go len funeral member bpe gentleman attend mensa meeting also send email networking job make think len rather another man meet mensa bpe describe funeral home saw wife maybe daughter saw casket think really look like get line view body walk get line people lay casket well something wake gathering meal,13.543683,13.785007,131,0,0,0,1,1,2,0,1,1,2,2
1656,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,269,2001-08-04,"I went to visit BJ in this new place that she was working. It might have been a school or college. It was an old building in disrepair. She was showing us around the building. I saw her poke her finger in a hole in the wall just noticing it I suppose. She was taking us somewhere. I think Bev was with some other women and me. We were going down steps and then all of a sudden we were going up steps. I noticed that she was smoking and I said something to her about that. She said, well, if you had been through some of the things that I have you would too. I responded, did I? I was insinuating that I did not start smoking as a result of any of my life tribulations. However, I was also thinking that I was being a bit dishonest because I did smoke for about three months after my divorce but no one knows that. When we were going up the steps, at the top of each flight we had to climb over a rail to get to the next flight. It was a little difficult to do. On one of them I saw another woman get over more easily and I was trying to figure out how she did that. It looked as if she just stepped down on the rail and then stepped over it. Later we were waiting to use the bathroom but there was only one. I thought I had seen another one so I went around a corner to check but there wasn't one. There were some people working in that room and another young woman that told me she was in hell year. I asked her what that meant and she said it meant she was a senior. She said it had taken her so long to get to her senior year. I told her it would be great and she should appreciate her final year. I went back out and I don't think I ever did get to use the bathroom. We went into a very large meeting or banquet room for a gathering. It was all open, no chairs or tables around. It was Christmas time. Someone was sitting with a large bag, kind of like the type you see in the Christmas movies being used by Santa. She was emptying it onto the floor. It was full of shower sandals. They were all black and the straps were glittery gold. I think there may have been some presents in it. A man drove a little tractor and trailers into the room. The trailers were full of presents. Several of us ran up to him right away but we had to move so he could get close to the tree. We were taking the presents off of the trailers and putting them under the tree and watching for the one with our own name on it. I remembered that we had submitted a list of things we would like so we would get something specific that we wanted. I noticed two toy typewriters for two of the little girls. I thought it was kind of neat that they asked for the same thing. BJ's gifts were oversized document frames with no glass in them. One of them had fallen apart and I thought that was pretty typical for document frames since they are so flimsy. there were these really huge frames with no glass in them. They were maybe 8 ft by 8 ft. They weren't wrapped. I was trying to pick them up but couldn't. I realized I couldn't because there were two men standing inside of them. One of them noticed me and stepped outside the frame but the other man didn't. I wasn't close enough to him to get his attention. I kept trying to pull the frame so it would rub against him, which it did. He kept noticing but he wouldn't move. The program had now started I guess. Finally someone else nudged him and pointed out that he was standing inside the frames and they helped me lift the frames from around him. When we were sitting the wrapped presents around the tree I was trying to set them so they looked nice. Some others were just stacking them on the floor. This annoyed me and then I realized that it wasn't worth being irritated over.",go visit bj new place work might school college old building disrepair show u around build saw poke finger hole wall notice suppose take u somewhere think bev woman go step sudden go step notice smoke say something say well thing would respond insinuate start smoking result life tribulation however also think bit dishonest smoke three month divorce one know go step top flight climb rail get next flight little difficult one saw another woman get easily try figure look step rail step later wait use bathroom one thought see another one go around corner check one people work room another young woman tell hell year ask mean say meant senior say take long get senior year tell would great appreciate final year go back think ever get use bathroom go large meeting banquet room gathering open chair table around christmas time someone sit large bag kind like type see christmas movie use santa empty onto floor full shower sandal black strap glittery gold think may present man drive little tractor trailer room trailer full present several u run right away move could get close tree take present trailer put tree watch one name remember submit list thing would like would get something specific want noticed two toy typewriter two little girl think kind neat ask thing bj gift oversized document frame glass one fall apart think pretty typical document frame since flimsy really huge frame glass maybe ft ft wrap try pick realize two men stand inside one notice step outside frame man close enough get attention keep try pull frame would rub keep noticing move program start guess finally someone else nudge point stand inside frame help lift frame around sit wrap present around tree try set look nice others stack floor annoy realize worth irritate,14.0043545,13.532928,750,5,13,5,3,6,4,6,7,6,17,2
1657,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,270,2001-08-05,"I was in this big dining hall. There was kind of like a Christmas party going on. Maybe for WDF or for DDSI. There were all these Christmas aprons hanging from wires above my head. They had the wires stretched from wall-to-wall. The aprons had various Christmas designs on them. I thought I should get one because I had intended to start wearing an apron in the kitchen. As I was walking around the room, there were tables displaying things that people had made. The things that I remember most were drink pitchers with matching glasses. They had painted designs on them. I was in a car with John Mu and Terri S from KTC. I don't know where we were headed but John was driving. We were seeing Halloween decorations at different places. As we went through underpasses, we saw that someone had put up giant Jack-0-Lanterns. This is next to impossible for me to describe. The best I can, is to say that where there were open spaces the Jack-O-Lanterns showed through. There were umbrellas and very unusual decorations. We stopped at one house and I don't know why. There were two young boys who lived there. They had built something they called an elevator out of wood. They had a rope that you pulled to lift yourself to the second floor. Right outside on the second floor was a patio door. Terri S said she was going to play with the boys, go outside, and use the elevator. The boys noticed her right away, came out, and asked what she was doing using their elevator. She came back down. The boys said something to their parents about someone using their elevator. She got back in the car and we left. I was debating with someone over whether or not to wear these gloves. I was at a theater. We were getting ready to produce a play. I was not supposed to be in the play. I don't know what my role was. At first, it seemed like we were doing a play of My Fair Lady. Later it seemed like we were doing a children's play like Barbie. It seemed to change several times throughout the dream. I don't remember what it ended up being. I spent a lot of time with the male producer/director back stage. Something like a hand vacuum was broken and he was trying to fix it, though he was unsuccessful. He was using a very small hammer. I took the hammer from him and told him to let me help. I decided I needed a larger hammer so we were looking for one. I finally found one and I fixed it. He was grateful for that. We started talking about very common things that I experience, but he had never had. Things like chips and salsa. He was very wealthy and just had not experienced very ordinary things. Over the course of us working together, he fell in love with me and he asked me to marry him. I said yes. We didn't tell anyone at first. The backstage area really sticks in my mind. There was clutter everywhere. At one place, you had to step down into another area. You stepped onto a floor of car batteries. There were two different levels of batteries. You had to walk on them instead of the floor. You couldn't even see the floor. He was waiting to tell the cast and crew about our engagement. It somehow got out but I don't know how unless he told someone. Most of the crew and cast were very happy for us. I was talking to someone about jobs and trying to find jobs that we really love. I said that I had been in school plays and that I really loved doing that. This is true in waking life but I would not imagine myself doing that full-time in waking life. She was encouraging me to pursue that as my full-time job. I had been thinking that was watching the other actors perform, that I should have been behind them practicing and learning the moves. I thought that would have been a good move for me, but I didn't do it. The play was a musical with a lot of dancing. I thought I could have learned the moves if I had practiced with them instead of just sitting and watching. I could have done this. Later the word got around to the whole cast about our engagement. One of the main female cast members was attracted to him, very upset about this, and intended to make sure it did not happen. It was almost as though I was watching a film. I wasn't with her or overhearing her, but watching her talk and interact with other cast members. Her and these other women were all dressed in costumes that remind me of My Fair Lady. Later, another woman, not in the cast, shows up and is talking to him. Again, it is not as if I am there watching, but I am seeing it. This woman is talking to him as though they are in a relationship and nothing has happened. He is very cool towards her and she doesn't understand why. I'm talking to this little girl. I asked her name and she said Annie H. I told her that is one of my favorite names because my middle name is Anna and my favorite Uncle used to call me Annie. I told her some about Uncle A. She said she was very happy that this man and I are going to marry. I don't know who she was, maybe a member of the cast. Several times he and I kissed. Usually, very long and passionate kisses. One time it was right in front of other cast members. That must have been when they found out. This news caused so much trouble with the cast that I think he backed off and I can't remember if he actually changed his mind. He was going through a lot of turmoil about whether to marry me or not.",big din hall kind like christmas party go maybe wdf ddsi christmas apron hang wire head wire stretch wall wall apron various christmas design think get one intend start wear apron kitchen walk around room table display thing people make thing remember drink pitcher match glass paint design car john mu terri ktc know head john drive see halloween decoration different place go underpass saw someone put giant jack lanterns next impossible describe best say open space jack lanterns show umbrellas unusual decoration stop one house know two young boy live build something call elevator wood rope pull lift second floor right outside second floor patio door terri say go play boy go outside use elevator boy notice right away come ask use elevator come back boy say something parent someone use elevator get back car leave debate someone whether wear glove theater get ready produce play suppose play know role first seem like play fair lady later seem like child play like barbie seem change several time throughout dream remember end spent lot time male producer director back stage something like hand vacuum break try fix though unsuccessful use small hammer take hammer tell let help decide need large hammer look one finally find one fix grateful start talk common thing experience never thing like chip salsa wealthy experience ordinary thing course u work together fell love ask marry say yes tell anyone first backstage area really stick mind clutter everywhere one place step another area step onto floor car battery two different level battery walk instead floor even see floor wait tell cast crew engagement somehow get know unless told someone crew cast happy u talk someone job try find job really love say school play really love true wake life would imagine full time wake life encourage pursue full time job think watch actor perform behind practice learn move thought would good move play musical lot dance thought could learn move practice instead sit watch could later word get around whole cast engagement one main female cast member attract upset intend make sure happen almost though watching film overhear watch talk interact cast member woman dress costume remind fair lady later another woman cast show talk watch see woman talk though relationship nothing happen cool towards understand talk little girl ask name say annie tell one favorite name middle name anna favorite uncle use call annie tell uncle say happy man go marry know maybe member cast several time kiss usually long passionate kiss one time right front cast member must find news cause much trouble cast think back remember actually change mind go lot turmoil whether marry,13.955274,13.648797,1045,5,14,4,6,12,8,7,18,11,27,2

1659,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,272,2001-08-12,"I was the owner of a large styling salon. A salesman came in to demonstrate and try to sell me a vacuum. It was a very powerful machine. I tried it out by vacuuming the entire salon. I used the attachments and vacuumed hair from around the baseboards. I accidentally moved the attachment right by a client's face and the stylist insinuated that the vacuum removed her facial hair from that side of her face by complimenting the client on how beautiful her skin was. I looked and noticed that she had facial hair on the other side of her face. I didn't do or say anything else about it. I finally told the salesman that I was going to be working on budgetary items during the coming week so I would be able to give him my decision then. I wanted the vacuum but I also think I was trying to give him an excuse rather than saying no to him at that point. My husband owned an auto and appliance repair business right next door to my salon. I went and talked to him about my intentions with budget and that I was considering some business changes that would improve both sales and profits and allow the stylists to make more money as well. I found out that my stylists rarely get any tips. I suggested that we should put a little sticker on the corner of each of their mirrors that says Tips are appreciated as this is an important part of our stylists income. When I first started talking to my stylists about some of the changes I was going to make all but 2 or 3 of them got up and quit. Eventually they all came back. I think as they spoke with the ones who stayed about the changes they became convinced that it would be a very good thing. My husband wasn't very supportive but he didn't stand in my way either. He didn't want me to do anything with his business though. I did suggest that they put up a basketball goal on the corner of his lot so the employees could relax a little on their breaks by shooting hoops. I also thought this was something that the employees wanted. I don't know if it actually happened or not. there was some kind of an evil person trying to sabotage my business. I don't remember much about this part. I did find out later that he was connected to my husband. as though my husband was behind it. I managed to get rid of this person though and the changes were being very successful. The stylists were dressing much nicer when they came to work. They were much happier, getting nice tips, and the clients were very happy with the changes. There was one stylist that was the hardest to win over. She had studied clinical counseling but then decided to become a stylist instead. She took care of her clients in a private room so they could speak privately with her while she took care of them. She wasn't acting in an official counseling capacity but used her knowledge to help them while she was taking care of their styling needs. She combined them in a manner as to not put herself or us in any kind of legal jeopardy. She was very happy when I encouraged this and gave her a private room so she could do so more effectively. Her clients were especially pleased with her. They had something to do with an airline or flights. There was a person that looked like or was dressed like an angel or a fairy, with sparkling wings that fell gently from the sky. She landed, or her wings became caught, on something like bleachers. This is where I found her and freed her. She was somehow connected to my husband and this evil person that I had to deal with earlier. Maybe she was a distraction.",owner large style salon salesman come demonstrate try sell vacuum powerful machine try vacuum entire salon use attachment vacuum hair around baseboard accidentally move attachment right client face stylist insinuate vacuum remove facial hair side face compliment client beautiful skin look notice facial hair side face say anything else finally tell salesman go work budgetary item come week would able give decision want vacuum also think try give excuse rather say point husband auto appliance repair business right next door salon go talked intention budget consider business change would improve sale profit allow stylist make money well find stylist rarely get tip suggest put little sticker corner mirror say tip appreciate important part stylists income first start talk stylist change go make get quit eventually come back think speak one stay change become convince would good thing husband supportive stand way either want anything business though suggest put basketball goal corner lot employee could relax little break shoot hoop also think something employee want know actually happen kind evil person try sabotage business remember much part find late connect husband though husband behind managed get rid person though change successful stylist dress much nicer come work much happy get nice tip client happy change one stylist hardest win study clinical counseling decide become stylist instead take care client private room could speak privately take care act official counsel capacity use knowledge help take care style need combine manner put u kind legal jeopardy happy encourage give private room could effectively client especially pleased something airline flight person look like dress like angel fairy sparkle wing fell gently sky land wing become caught something like bleacher find free somehow connected husband evil person deal earlier maybe distraction,13.763232,13.760095,674,5,14,4,5,15,4,7,19,10,22,2

I was shaking and very frightened. Finally, my parents entered the room. Just after they did though I realized they were a kind of apparition. They floated into my room and fell on me in the bed.

I was determined to get it done so I was trying to roll it myself and I was getting really frustrated. I had taken them out and started over. My hair got dry so I had to completely wet it again.

1662,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,275,2001-08-21,"I'm at the Holiday Inn at MI. I check in at the front desk. I go to get on the elevator. I had a garbage bag of clothes to be donated to Goodwill or someplace. As I was standing there waiting for the elevator two men come and stand right in front of me for the elevator. One of them has a cart and the other has a trash bag larger than mine. I told them, you know if there isn't room on the elevator after you two get on that I will be mad at you. They kind of stepped to the side and the elevator opened so I went in first. Then we don't have our trash bags anymore but there are quite a few people on the elevator. The elevator car is pretty full. It starts making noises. It is kind of jerky and moves side-to-side. Everyone is pretty nervous. I was thinking, I want to get out of here. I need to get out of here. We are headed to the 6th floor. It doesn't stop and it goes back down again. I get off at the second floor thinking that. I don't know if I didn't realize that I was not on the 5th floor. I started walking to find my room. There were several large businesses having meetings out in this open area instead of in meeting rooms. I had to walk by them to get to my room. I'm looking at them trying to figure out what the companies were. I realized one of them is LRJ. I saw Carol H. She saw me and calls out to me, then comes over to where I am standing. We say hello and hug and chat a little bit. She looks a little different, like she had gained a little weight and she was wearing glasses. We had a nice chat and she said she had to get back to her meeting. I need to go find my room so I walked away. I am trying to find my room and I realize I don't remember my room number, I don't have my key with me and I don't have my luggage. I asked someone where 650 or 620 are. They tell me I am on the second floor. That is when I realized I am not on the right floor. I had to walk past these meetings again. There is very little room to walk through. There are people sitting at the ends of the table but not up next to the table. So I had to walk between them and the table. I keep walking. One of the groups is having a sit-down dinner. At two of these tables the women are having mashed potatoes and gravy. They put potatoes right on the tablecloth instead of on a plate. I was wearing a white suit. As I walk between these women and the tables to squeeze through I get their mashed potatoes and gravy on my suit. They don't seem to care and don't apologize. One said, well, you can get that out with a little soap and water. I was nice and polite and said, Yes, I can. I went on. I get back to the elevator and really don't want to get back on because I was so scared the last time. There are other people standing there waiting also. There is a row of four elevators. Two of the elevators are standing open but there is camera equipment standing in the open. As the doors try to close they close on this equipment so they can't close all the way. The next things we see are the doors moving side to side. I started thinking Oh no. Here we go again. At first I thought maybe if I got on another elevator it would be okay but I now realize that all four of them have the same problem. I don't remember getting back on or off the elevator. I see Kendall B standing and talking to a group of people. I'm standing there looking for a little bit wondering if it is really him, because he looks a little different. His hair is a little fuller and has streaks of gray. After he finishes speaking he walks up to me and I introduce myself. He said it was nice to meet me. Then another man walks up and introduces me. At that point I realize this is his life partner. I'm talking to the two of them and quite a few children kept coming up to us. I realized it is their children. There were approximately 8-10 of different ages. His partner asked me what I do and I wasn't sure how to answer that because of my unemployment. I talked a little about my dreamwork. I told Kendall B that I had some communication with Doctor Du about the sleep positions so we talked some about that. Then Kendall B was telling me that they were there doing some work and he had to hire someone to help him. He said if I had known that I lived so close by he would have called me. I said that would have been wonderful. I was really disappointed that he hadn't contacted me. His children were doing something with videos and stuff. They were talking about going to their rooms and have TV dinners in their room. There were boxes that looked like they had about 10 videos to a box. Kendall B said, That's what we have to do. I looked at him quizzically because I didn't know what he meant. I asked, What do you have to do? He said, You don't know? I said, No, I don't. Please try to be kind when you answer me, so I don't feel even more stupid for not knowing. I don't think he or his partner either one answered me. The boxes were kind of flat and two rows of five movies each. We are outside. One of their children is reaching through a fence and trying to kill a rabbit. I said Oh no. Please don't do that. I said I have a pet rabbit at home and I would really hate to see you hurt one. So they stopped. Then this rabbit caught another animal, a smaller animal. I thought he was going to kill it to eat it. The rabbit got the animal in a position to where he could bite it in the neck and it died. I hated seeing that. I don't like to see any creature killed and I certainly don't want to witness it. Kendall B or his partner were saying, that's the cycle of nature, trying to make me feel better. Then there was a male on the other side of the fence trying to kill a rabbit. I got upset again. I thought, Please don't do that. He had already killed one but he did let that one go. I said, that kind of looks like Sir Gallahad except those have more white on them. Sir Gallahad is a Mini-Rex and his coat is really soft like chinchilla.",holiday inn mi check front desk go get elevator garbage bag clothes donate goodwill someplace stand wait elevator two men come stand right front elevator one cart trash bag large mine tell know room elevator two get mad kind step side elevator open go first trash bag anymore quite people elevator elevator car pretty full start make noise kind jerky move side side everyone pretty nervous think want get need get head floor stop go back get second floor thinking know realize floor start walk find room several large business meeting open area instead meeting room walk get room look try figure company realize one lrj saw carol saw call come stand say hello hug chat little bit look little different like gain little weight wear glass nice chat say get back meeting need go find room walk away try find room realize remember room number key luggage ask someone tell second floor realize right floor walk past meeting little room walk people sit end table next table walk table keep walk one group sit dinner two table woman mash potato gravy put potato right tablecloth instead plate wear white suit walk woman table squeeze get mash potato gravy suit seem care apologize one say well get little soap water nice polite say yes go get back elevator really want get back scar last time people stand wait also row four elevator two elevator stand open camera equipment stand open door try close close equipment close way next thing see door move side side start think oh go first think maybe get another elevator would okay realize four problem remember get back elevator see kendall stand talk group people stand look little bit wonder really look little different hair little fuller streak gray finish speak walk introduce say nice meet another man walk introduces point realize life partner talk two quite child keep come u realize child approximately different age partner ask sure answer unemployment talk little dreamwork tell kendall communication doctor du sleep position talk kendall tell work hire someone help say know live close would call say would wonderful really disappointed contact child something video stuff talk go room tv dinner room box look like video box kendall say look quizzically know meant ask say know say please try kind answer feel even stupid know think partner either one answer box kind flat two row five movie outside one child reach fence try kill rabbit say oh please say pet rabbit home would really hate see hurt one stop rabbit catch another animal small animal think go kill eat rabbit get animal position could bite neck die hat see like see creature kill certainly want witness kendall partner say cycle nature try make feel good male side fence try kill rabbit get upset thought please already kill one let one go say kind look like sir gallahad except white sir gallahad mini rex coat really soft like chinchilla,13.784124,13.592502,1233,6,10,9,8,9,11,3,15,17,20,2

1664,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,277,2001-09-05,"I was with Karyn L. I was in the car with her. We were on the way to pick up Carmen A and to catch a plane with the rest of our classmates to Australia. We were driving and we turned left on this street and we knew we had to turn left again. Karyn L said, This is where I always get confused. I never know exactly where to turn. She turned where her and I both thought she was supposed to. There was a car parked there. I thought there was enough room to get through. Either she didn't think there was enough room or there may have been some bars there. I was sure that was the way so she told me to go ahead and check. But it was raining. I didn't worry about that because most of where I would be walking was under cover. As I was walking I realized that there was another way that I thought she could get through. When I get through and turned around and looked I realized that it was the right place. I don't know how Karyn L ever actually got through there. We didn't just pick Carmen A up. We were in a theater. Carmen A was there with some other people. It seems that maybe some of our classmates were there. Someone was talking to us about our trip. I eventually went down to the front to sit. There were knee-deep piles of popcorn all over the place so I was eating some of the popcorn. Some of it had a lot more butter on it than others so I was reaching for that. There was an activity that we were supposed to participate in. just like a fun exercise. I don't remember what it was or what happened. Then, Daniel R showed up. He and I talked for a little bit. It was as though nothing had happened and no time had passed. I took him to introduce him to Karyn L and Mary Kay C and someone else. I was disappointed because they said hello and not much more. Karyn L got up and walked away. I was upset with Karyn L, when she met Daniel R, that she didn't grill him more or ask more questions or anything like that. I stood there and talked to him more. We walked away and continued to talk. I realized that my class was either practicing or participating in some activity on stage. I think they were practicing so I ran behind stage quick because I realized I was supposed to be there. Carmen A had on an aqua blue dress. It had an apron. She was like a waitress. Another woman yanked an apron off of her. She had two on, one on top of the other. She gave the extra to me along with a cup and a sugar jar like you would see in a diner. I set the sugar jar and the cup down while I was trying to put on my apron. I realized that my apron didn't fit well. I had to tie it around my waist and the ties weren't quite long enough. By the time I got ready the number, practice, whatever was done. We had ordered dinner to take with us. While I was waiting for this I started talking to Daniel R again. He was saying that he was going to be getting an apartment here in Indy and maybe looking for a roommate and only a female and only if it was a relationship. I think he was hinting around about it being me. I just thought that there was no way I wanted to do that again. Even being with him there was no way I wanted to be intimate with him. I was thinking that the last time I saw him he was saying the same thing. He just disappeared for a year and now he just shows up again. I was trying to pin something to my collar while I was listening to Daniel R talk to me. All of a sudden I realize that I need to go. I grab my food and run and try to catch the others. I'm not finding them. I don't remember if they left without me or if I just need to catch up with them. We had actually flown to Australia, done part of what we were supposed to do and flown back. We had less than a day and then we had to get on the plane and go again. I was thinking that if I hadn't been standing there talking to Daniel R and futzing with my collar I wouldn't have missed them. I had really mixed feelings about him being there again. There was a part of me that wanted him to stay around with me and another part that just wanted to tell him to go away and leave me alone and never come back.",karyn car way pick carmen catch plane rest classmates australia drive turn leave street know turn leave karyn say always get confuse never know exactly turn turned thought suppose car park think enough room get either think enough room may bar sure way tell go ahead check rain worry would walk cover walk realize another way thought could get get turn around look realize right place know karyn ever actually get pick carmen theater carmen people seem maybe classmates someone talk u trip eventually go front sit knee deep pile popcorn place eat popcorn lot butter others reach activity suppose participate like fun exercise remember happen daniel show talk little bit though nothing happen time pas take introduce karyn mary kay someone else disappoint say hello much karyn get walk away upset karyn meet daniel grill ask question anything like stood talk walk away continue talk realize class either practice participate activity stage think practice run behind stage quick realize suppose carmen aqua blue dress apron like waitress another woman yank apron two one top give extra along cup sugar jar like would see diner set sugar jar cup try put apron realize apron fit well tie around waist tie quite long enough time get ready number practice whatever order dinner take u wait start talk daniel say go get apartment indy maybe look roommate female relationship think hint around think way want even way want intimate think last time saw say thing disappear year show try pin something collar listening daniel talk sudden realize need go grab food run try catch others find remember leave without need catch actually fly australia part suppose fly back less day get plane go think stand talk daniel futzing collar miss really mixed feel part want stay around another part want tell go away leave alone never come back,14.0225,13.450003,849,3,8,2,1,3,5,4,4,6,14,2
1665,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,278,2001-09-07,"I had gone to a morning OD meeting at a restaurant. There weren't very many people there and it wasn't structured. People were getting up and walking into the kitchen. Some were just walking around. We were the only ones in the restaurant. I talked primarily to one gentleman. I was trying to get something useful from this meeting. He was talking about OI. In waking life I have no idea if there is even such a thing. It seemed as though it was industrial OD. I was asking him if he thought that was a good area for me to pursue. I kept stressing that I what I want most to do is use my training/lecturing and writing skills. The whole meeting seemed very unhelpful. I left there and went to the anniversary party. I got there late, in time for the reception. I missed the mass because it had started earlier than I thought. I was aggravated with BJ because she didn't tell me what time I needed to be there. I wondered if people got videos of the Mass so I could at least see that. They were taking lots of pictures. One thing that was particularly unusual is that there was a corner curio cabinet with glass shelves. There was a space in the back of the cabinet between the back of the shelves and the back of the cabinet. They were having people sit in the cabinet in this space. They were taking pictures of each person in attendance in this cabinet and they were putting things on the shelves that represented each person. They were thinking about what to put on the shelves to take my picture. There were some barbecued chicken wings that I was eating. Bob F asked me how they were. I was nice and said they were good. I thought the sauce was good but that if had bought the chicken at another store they would have been juicier or more tender and with more meat on them. There was one table that members of the Harris family were sitting at. They had a very large tray and they had made high piles of desserts on it like cake and brownies. They had filled it full of things they were going to take home with them. I was taking the slices of cake off looking for something but then putting them back on. Linda W said that was fine as long as I didn't mess up their cake. Kim H went to the microphone. This was a dream within a dream. At the end of the dream I was with my siblings telling them I had this dream and that we could use it to see what things happened that we didn't like and what things we did that we especially liked but maybe weren't planning.",go morning od meeting restaurant many people structure people get walk kitchen walk around one restaurant talk primarily one gentleman try get something useful meeting talk oi wake life idea even thing seem though industrial od ask think good area pursue keep stress want use train lecture write skill whole meeting seem unhelpful leave go anniversary party get late time reception miss mass start earlier thought aggravate bj tell time need wonder people get videos mass could least see take lot picture one thing particularly unusual corner curio cabinet glass shelf space back cabinet back shelve back cabinet people sit cabinet space take picture person attendance cabinet put thing shelf represent person think put shelf take picture barbecue chicken wing eat bob ask nice say good thought sauce good buy chicken another store would juicier tender meat one table member harris family sit large tray make high pile dessert like cake brownie fill full thing go take home take slice cake look something put back linda say fine long mess cake kim go microphone dream within dream end dream sibling tell dream could use see thing happen like thing especially like maybe plan,13.811137,13.830125,483,1,7,2,1,2,1,1,5,4,8,2
1666,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,279,2001-09-08,"I was on GC campus but with my CIIS classmates. I was talking to Terri O, asking her what to do about my class with Elisabeth K. She didn't answer me. She had some notes in a notebook that she had me copy down. I asked her if she was going to be putting it on-line and she said no and looked at me funny. I said, I'm sorry. I only asked because I thought you had previously. I was having trouble reading her writing but went ahead and started copying it. We were all sitting around waiting to leave to go home. There were two men that I was talking to. Something came up about chicken mcnuggets and they didn't know what they were. I was trying to explain it to them and I saw some sitting there. So I picked one up and took a bite out of it. As soon as I did I realized that was nasty because I didn't know who they belonged to or ho long they had been sitting there. Bonnie K was standing there at a counter next to me. I was cleaning up and putting plastic forks and spoons where they belonged and throwing some trash away. Just generally cleaning up a little bit. Then I heard we were having a burn drill. Half the people were gone already but we still went outside and had it. There was a big dip over to a high area of grass. Instead of going down and back up I just jumped across and barely made it. Where we were supposed to congregate we were supposed to form a circle but people wouldn't spread out very well. Where I was standing it was very crowded so it wasn't a single circle of people, but rather some of us were bunched up. I don't know what a burn drill is. We were supposed to sing a song. One half of the circle was supposed to sing first and then the other half was supposed to sing it. Carmen A was standing next to me and looked at me kind of funny. I don't know what that was about. Then we went back into the building. The CIIS staff was packing up and getting ready to go. They had tons of boxes of stuff sitting around all over. I made a comment that the hard part comes now, packing all that stuff up and getting back. They said they just had to take it to the basement, but, yes it wasn't a pleasant part of the job. Then Matt O walked up and I hardly recognized him. I said something to him about being dressed up. He had on a sports jacket and a tie. His sports jacket was kind of royal blue and he was wearing his glasses. But he was also wearing a toupee. black hair. that covered his whole head. I told him he looked really nice. We were talking out together. I was carrying or pulling my bags but he had a four-wheel cart full of stuff. We were walking out to catch the plane. He was teasing me about some other man wanting me. I looked at him and laughed. I put my hand on his arm and said, oh, do you Matthew? He said, Yes. I do. He kind of laughed. I apologized and said I just couldn't resist. That it was just a perfect set up. He said, no problem. Then I realized that I didn't know why he was walking with us because he was driving back to LA rather than flying with the rest of us.",gc campus ciis classmates talk terri ask class elisabeth answer note notebook copy ask go put line say look funny say sorry ask think previously trouble read write go ahead start copy sit around wait leave go home two men talk something come chicken mcnuggets know try explain saw sit pick one take bite soon realize nasty know belong ho long sit bonnie stand counter next cleaning put plastic fork spoon belong throw trash away generally clean little bit heard burn drill half people go already still go outside big dip high area grass instead go back jump across barely make suppose congregate suppose form circle people spread well stand crowd single circle people rather u bunch know burn drill suppose sing song one half circle suppose sing first half suppose sing carmen stand next look kind funny know go back build ciis staff pack get ready go ton box stuff sit around make comment hard part come pack stuff get back say take basement yes pleasant part job matt walk hardly recognize say something dressed sport jacket tie sport jacket kind royal blue wear glass also wear toupee black hair cover whole head tell look really nice talk together carry pull bag four wheel cart full stuff walk catch plane tease man want look laugh put hand arm say oh matthew say yes kind laugh apologize say resist perfect set say problem realize know walk u drive back la rather fly rest u,13.870309,13.703664,622,2,6,2,5,4,8,3,5,10,14,2
1667,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,280,2001-09-09,"Cindy S was dead. For some reason we had to exhume her body and there was someone else that we had to bury. I think we were going to bury this other person, maybe, right next to where she was buried. We didn't want to do it at the same time because we didn't want to impose on the S's while they were exhuming Cindy S's body. We talked to one of the S boys to make sure that wasn't going to be a problem. They assured us that it wasn't. Steve S was her brother. [but he was her cousin in waking life] I think Paul S was also her brother. [Paul S was also a cousin in waking life and deceased]. Maybe Tim S and Don St, though they are cousins also. In waking life, Steve S, Paul S, Don St and Tim S are all brothers. When they exhumed the body it wasn't in a casket but was wrapped in. It almost looked like aluminum foil but it was much larger than if the body was just wrapped in foil. It was like there were a lot of layers. I can't really explain it. I also don't know who the other body was that we were burying. Cindy S was alive again. Then she was dead again and they reburied her. After they reburied her I was wearing a necklace of hers. I don't know if she had given it to me or how I got it or why I was wearing it. Her father, not her waking life father, came in to church and sat down next to me because he had not been able to be present at the time that they exhumed the body and then reburied her because he had to be at a business meeting. I showed him the necklace to reassure him that it was her and that she was doing well and tried to give him some comfort. I thought how sad it was that on such an occasion that he could not be present because of a business meeting. We were back at the cemetery and I was picking up these sticks. In diameter they were the size of a pencil but they were much longer. On the end they had a kind of crook on them and they were light green. I was picking them up and sticking them in the ground at each gravesite that something had to be done to them. I was trying to find these open, vertical pipes or something so I could put the stick down into the pipe. I did four in a row. It was to mark the graves for something that had to be done later. Some of the graves had folded lawn chairs sitting up against the tombstones. People would come and sit there at the grave of their loved ones. One of them was Uncle E. I was thinking that Aunt M probably goes and sits there quite often.",cindy dead reason exhume body someone else bury think go bury person maybe right next bury want time want impose exhume cindy body talk one boy make sure go problem assure u steve brother cousin wake life think paul also brother paul also cousin wake life decease maybe tim st though cousin also wake life steve paul st tim brother exhume body casket wrap almost look like aluminum foil much large body wrap foil like lot layer really explain also know body bury cindy alive dead reburied reburied wear necklace know give get wear father wake life father come church sit next able present time exhume body reburied business meeting show necklace reassure well tried give comfort think sad occasion could present business meeting back cemetery picking stick diameter size pencil much longer end kind crook light green pick stick ground gravesite something try find open vertical pipe something could put stick pipe four row mark grave something later graf fold lawn chair sit tombstone people would come sit grave love one one uncle think aunt probably go sits quite often,13.585019,13.578542,511,1,6,1,5,6,7,2,15,8,13,2

1670,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,283,2001-09-17,"I was a very young girl. I think it was me. But I have a mixed sense of whether it was me or if I was observing. I needed to find a place to live and so this man gave me an apartment in his building. He was the landlord. But in exchange I had to be with these different men and I had to get pregnant and have a baby. At first I didn't seem to mind it but I think after the baby was born he would carry us upstairs several floors to his apartment and then he would throw us down a space between the flights of steps. There was space in-between the flights of steps that just went straight down to the bottom floor. You could see all the way down from the top floor to the bottom. He would knock us down in this space to kill the baby, even though he wanted me to get pregnant and have these babies for him. I was trying to escape. My father, who is in a band, was going to take me in. I went to this apartment with my father and his band and it turns out that they wanted the same thing from me, only with them. It started out that he asked specifically who I was supposed to be with. It just wasn't working but I didn't know why. I asked my mother if she thought it would be okay if I had sex with one of the band members instead. She talked to my father and he said it would be okay. [unknown] They started playing music. I was supposed to start being romantic and having sex with this man. I went up to the one band member that I was attracted to and I started flirting with him. He was the keyboardist. He quit playing and sat there and then we went out to a car. My father followed us. He opened the car door and was very angry. But he was angry because this band member was apparently impotent. I think my mother must have intervened and calmed him down and asked him to let me try anyway. There was all of this fine powdery snow inside the car, waist high to the band member that was sitting in the driver seat. So my father used his hand and was brushing the snow out of the car and then agreed to let me try and it worked. I think my father was doing the same thing as the other man. He was trying to kill either the band member or the baby afterwards by throwing them down the same space between the flights of steps. I think either I or someone else ended up throwing him down the space in-between the steps.",young girl think mixed sense whether observe need find place live man give apartment build landlord exchange different men get pregnant baby first seem mind think baby bear would carry u upstairs several floor apartment would throw u space flight step space flight step go straight bottom floor could see way top floor bottom would knock u space kill baby even though wanted get pregnant baby try escape father band go take go apartment father band turn want thing start ask specifically suppose work know ask mother thought would okay sex one band member instead talk father say would okay unknown start play music suppose start romantic sex man go one band member attract start flirt keyboardist quit play sit go car father follow u open car door angry angry band member apparently impotent think mother must intervene calm ask let try anyway fine powdery snow inside car waist high band member sit driver seat father use hand brush snow car agree let try work think father thing man try kill either band member baby afterwards throw space flight step think either someone else end throw space step,13.971844,13.30547,476,1,9,1,3,6,4,1,7,8,13,2

She was asking questions about the status of our child support agreement. As usual, I was getting more and more angry with Darren and found myself yelling at him. I was flipping through my file cabinets while I was talking to try to have the exact numbers in front of me when I spoke. I said, you make $56,000. Then I hesitated and changed it to $74,000 a year and still think that $70 a week in child support is adequate. He then told the other person on the phone that he wanted to file a petition for the child support to go directly to Matthew. While I was talking on the phone BJ's family arrived, suitcases in hand, and Matthew was taking them into his bedroom to get settled. I'm not sure why they were here, especially to spend the night.

1672,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,285,2001-09-19,"I was preparing for a party to celebrate receiving my certificate for a part of my program, not my Ph.D. I was living in this big fancy house. Reminds me somewhat of Tom G and Shirley J's old house except that it wasn't well decorated, not a lot of decorations. Obviously much different than my current home. All the doorknobs were___can't describe it. I'm getting ready for this party and worrying some about it because my whole family is coming for it and I don't know where I am going to put everyone. I wanted to hide something but someone convinced me to just let it out in the open and let people know that I'm not afraid. Mother and Daddy ended up bringing most of the food for this dinner. I was going to set up my card table and folding chairs and hope that somehow we would have enough room. People started arriving and I wasn't ready yet. For some reason I was feeling very angry and I couldn't identify why. I was very upset. I went to my bedroom to change and left everyone downstairs. I came back down because I heard a terrible scream and commotion. Nicholas F was running around in a panic. Bob F was trying to gather his other children and saying, we are going to the hospital now. They weren't planning on coming back. I gave him directions to Community North Hospital because it is the closest and they can get there very quickly. All of his children had been roller blading in the street in front of my house. Apparently, someone had rollerbladed over Nicholas F's hand and cut it very severely. Bev came up to my bedroom after I had returned there to try again to change my clothes. She talked to me a little bit. I apologized for how I had been talking earlier that day and told her that I had been in a really bad mood and not even sure why. I didn't tell her this but I was thinking that part of the reason for my mood was Nick R. I finished dressing and went downstairs. Everything was ready. The BBQ they had made. I had started making mashed potatoes and that was there. Dessert was there, etc. I had to go back upstairs for something and called downstairs to Bill F and asked him to get the folding table and chairs out of the coat closet. In the meantime, Bev, Mother and BJ were getting the food on the table. While I was upstairs I was talking to someone and asked if anyone had heard from BJ. Then I said oh, yeah, duh. She's here. Then I asked about the rest of her family. Todd A was the only one that was there. Nobody knew if the rest of her family was coming or not. So, we were ready to eat and I grabbed my lighter because I wanted to light a bunch of candles all over the house. I was trying to do that while other people were getting their food. Darren was there for some reason and he had invited his family. But they were all older black people. They were bothered by Bob F's children and the other children running around, playing, and creating a commotion. I was talking to Mother and Daddy about Darren and his family being there. I asked them if they thought we had enough food. It seemed to me that they were planning on eating. Daddy said we would just have to wait and see.

1673,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,286,2001-09-19,"Someone was trying to break into my house through the front door. I realized that I did not have the alarm set, even though the dead bolt was set and the chain was on. They were trying to break the wood. I was leaning against the wood of the door to try to keep them out and I reached up and set the alarm. As they heard it beeping to set they took off. I looked out the peephole and saw that it was three young males all dressed in black. As they took off they had to run over a huge pile of rubble in my front yard that resembled the piles of rubble rescue workers are going through in NY right now. While I was dreaming I thought that's what it looked like. I realized the alarm wasn't working because it didn't set. I ran and got my phone to call 911. They came back and started trying again. I called 911 and could hardly speak. They found something to unlock the deadbolt. I managed to turn it back again and hold it against their efforts to unlock it again. Then I saw the chain was off and reached up and refastened it. I looked through the peephole again and one of the young men was looking through the hole back at me. I wasn't sure if he could see me. I kept to one side and was looking out at an angle. I slowly moved my finger across the hole to be sure he wouldn't see me. They seemed to be making progress at getting the wood in the door to give. I placed my back against the door where they were trying to make it break in and then I placed my feet against the steps directly across from the door.

1674,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,287,2001-09-22,"I was preparing to fix myself a meal. I went to the freezer and decided that I should eat something that I have had in there for some time. In the process I found things I didn't realize were in there or things that I had forgotten were in there. I took a round, forest green tablecloth folded in half out to the front porch, deciding that I would eat out there for a change. It was a classic picnic table like you would see in a park. There was already a cranberry colored tablecloth on the table so I placed the green one, still folded, over part of one lengthwise side of the table so you could see both. I think I placed something else on the table too but I can't remember what it was. I went back inside and started rearranging the things in the refrigerator. Now I was working in a dorm-side refrigerator, finding all kinds of things. I thought, I keep forgetting this one is even here. I found things that we had put in that freezer, leftovers from my son's high school graduation party in June. There were two packages of hot dogs; each one had been opened so I combined them. There were ziplock bags of sliced cheese and crackers that I decided to put in the other refrigerator so I would remember to use them for my bedtime snack. There was a package of sausage. As I was moving things I found some very old lettuce in the back. I took it out and laid it aside to throw away. I also found an individual serving bottle of juice with no lid on it. There were a couple of things that were just a bite or two and I took them out thinking that I would just consume them now rather than keeping them and I wouldn't dare just throw them out. I took the juice bottle out to drink right away as well. As I was picking up the lettuce off the floor I put it in the sink to put in the garbage disposal. Now it was much more than when I took it out and there were other things as well. It filled one side of the sink. While I was doing this, there were three men sitting at my kitchen table. One of them was interviewing the other two about 911. They kept glancing at me and what I was doing. For some reason I also had tools and parts lying on the floor around me as though I was fixing the refrigerator as well. I realized I would have to move some of these things when they were ready to leave or they would not be able to get out. I did this as I saw them wrapping up and they got up to leave. The interviewer left and the other two stood there and talked with each other. The one started crying because the interviewer had given him such a hard time.",prepare fix meal go freezer decide eat something time process find thing realize thing forget take round forest green tablecloth fold half front porch decide would eat change classic picnic table like would see park already cranberry color tablecloth table place green one still fold part one lengthwise side table could see think place something else table remember go back inside start rearrange thing refrigerator work dorm side refrigerator find kind thing think keep forget one even find thing put freezer leftover son high school graduation party june two package hot dog one open combine ziplock bag slice cheese cracker decide put refrigerator would remember use bedtime snack package sausage move thing find old lettuce back take lay aside throw away also find individual serving bottle juice lid couple thing bite two take think would consume rather keep dare throw take juice bottle drink right away well pick lettuce floor put sink put garbage disposal much take thing well fill one side sink three men sit kitchen table one interview two keep glance reason also tool part lie floor around though fix refrigerator well realize would move thing ready leave would able get saw wrap get leave interviewer leave two stand talk one start cry interviewer give hard time,13.933639,13.725133,511,2,6,2,4,4,3,3,6,7,8,2
1675,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,288,2001-09-23,"I was in bed listening to an audio book. Matthew came in and lay down behind me and put his arm around me. I took the headphones off and asked him if he was okay. I could hardly speak so I had to ask him three times. I don't know if he answered me. Then we were in a car driving to my parent's house. Matthew was younger now-maybe 12 or 13 years old. He was asleep in the car. As we approached my parent's house I realized we hadn't eaten yet so I decided to drive to Oldtown to get some fried chicken. Matthew woke up and was upset because I was going to do that. It was about 3 a.m. and I asked him if he wanted breakfast instead but he didn't answer me. I told him it wouldn't take long. I found my way even though I wasn't sure I remembered how to get there. It didn't take as long as it would have in waking life and the roads to get there were different than in waking life. The place to park came up on me quickly so I quickly diverted off the road into a roadside parking area. When I got out of the car Matthew was already out and had crossed the street to a house. It was dark but they had lights on. I saw the door open and saw my family, particularly daddy, sitting inside. I wondered whose house that was and why they were in there. I didn't even think about why Matthew went there or knew to go there. As I entered the house, Mother met me and started talking to me about people with ADD and how other people misunderstand them and misinterpret their words or actions and don't give them enough credit for how intelligent they are because of that. I wondered why she was telling me that and wondered if someone had told her about my having ADD. I was also still wondering who the house belonged to and had a sense that the family had gone together and bought this house for me to make up for things in my life. I quickly realized, however, that the house was BJ's new house and they were just moving in. Matthew and I went to the refrigerator and found some kind of green fruit juice. I had to kneel on the floor to get it and got dirt on my black pants. We then went in and sat in the living room. Jody S was talking about ADD like she was an expert on the subject. I realized she was quoting the audio book I had been listening to but she wasn't giving the author credit. I was upset and thought that wasn't right that she wasn't giving credit to the author. I finally stood up and walked a little bit and said Jody S, how do you do that? You just quoted the book I've been listening to. She looked at me like she didn't like what I had said. That was okay because I didn't like that she was passing this knowledge off as though it were her own or as though she knew these things from researching the topic. She just shrugged her shoulders and didn't say anything. I sat back down next to Matthew and then he started doing it. I jumped up and said basically the same thing to him.

1677,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,290,2001-09-24,"I was working as a dream therapist, consulting clients. In this building there was a lot of construction or it was being majorly remodeled. I was in this room that was going to be my office and sitting area. There were several people sitting there waiting to see me. It started out with just one and then all of a sudden there were five sitting there waiting for me. None of them had an appointment. I came out and was trying to take care of them. Shirley H was standing there also, but I'm not sure why. I had a sense that Matt O. was there but I don't recall seeing him. I spoke briefly with Shirley H and then went to the five people who were waiting for me. I'm really sorry there are so many of you waiting for me, but since none of you have appointments, let's see what each of you need and see how we can take care of each of you. Three of them had computer questions, based on things that they had heard me say before, that they thought I would be able to help them with. One of them was trying to install a program and but it told her she needed higher walls. Another one was trying to install a program, I think it was maybe like Anytime, but every time she got to one point her program would shut off. Since Shirley H was standing there I asked her if she was busy or in the middle of something. I told her that these three people had computer questions that I couldn't answer and thought she might be able to. She said she would be happy to talk to them. So I sent three of them to her. I then went to another of the women was there. She said she was there to talk to me about a client she had referred to me. Neither of us could remember the woman's name. So I went to my computer. I knew who she meant and what day she was in. So I went to my appointment book. Somehow my computer showed me the picture of these people, sitting in my waiting room. I was trying to go into the actual appointment book part to look up her name. I was having all kinds of problems with the computer. I somehow couldn't get the mouse where I needed it to be. Someone said something to me and I turned and looked over my right shoulder and there was another computer. Somehow I was trying to use my computer using the mouse from that other computer station behind me and too the right. I said, I don't know what my mouse is doing back here anyway. So I picked it up and brought it back to my computer. I was still having problems and I called Shirley H and asked if she could help. I thought, I know what I'll do. I'll just reboot. About that time Shirley H reached from behind me and unplugged it. I said no, no, no. She had already unplugged it and plugged it back in, so it restarted. It turned out to be fine and it just took a little bit longer. I finally found the woman and her name was Linda Coland [unknown in waking life]. I asked this other woman if that is the person she was there to talk to me about and she said yes. I went over and sat on a footstool in front of her. She was a thin woman dressed in black or burgundy. She had shorter length black hair and glasses. She was very thin. Maybe my age or a bit younger. I think maybe Shirley H sat down with me too. She was there to follow up with me regarding this person she had referred to me. She asked me how my session with her was and what the follow up was. I just told her that my session went fine and that I had referred her to Doctor Bl. This woman was very upset by that. I apologized and told her that I thought that was the best thing I could do for Linda. I helped her as much as I could in our session. I asked her why that bothered her. She said, well, I wish you had referred her back to me. Well, I didn't even know who referred her to me, let alone know that it was a psychotherapist that had referred her to me. So, she kind of shrugged her shoulders and left, I think. Actually, I think I did that before the other people showed up and that's when I found out three of them had computer questions. The person that was left was Linda Coland. Before I could get to her, she walking around looking at my shelves of books in my waiting area. One of the construction workers came up to and asked me if I wanted a partial wall or anything in my office. I said by all means. I said, what I would really like is a full wall with a door. So, I went and was standing and talking to this Linda Coland. She climbed down from something and walked under a ladder to me. She said, I'm doing very well. I'm doing much better. I said, I'm so happy to hear that. Let's go into my office and sit down and talk. So she went ahead in and by then they had already put in this wall and two doors. I though I would pull the doors shut which I tried to do. There were these white, looked like logs, in the way. I tried to move them out of the way with my foot but they were too heavy. So I bent over and moved them out of the way with my hands. I pulled the doors shut but they wouldn't meet. There was a six-inch gap. I said, Oh, look at that. That's such a shame. That's alright, we'll just leave them like that for now.

He was talking to me about my paper and how there were several questions and I only answered one of them, and even then I only answered with a couple of paragraphs. It was just barely passing work. He just didn't understand and was really bothered by this. He said, I'm sorry. I said, no, don't be sorry. I feel the same way. My work has not at all been what I would like it to be. This aren't really excuses but. I told him about the year I've had being unemployed, etc. So unfortunately it was not just your class that suffered. It was the others as well. In some way that made him feel a little better. Still, he was a little disappointed. So I asked him if there was anyway to make it up or to redo the paper or add to it or anything.

1679,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,292,2001-09-25,"I was walking around outside. I was sitting on a stone ledge. Connie B and Susan J were there. I was talking to Connie B about the old house. She said there were so many people living in there with her right now. She was so frustrated. She said the families, and one maybe in particular, had a bunch of cats living with her in her room. One part of the dream I am with Paulette W, Joan Collins, and another woman. There is a man there too. Paulette W and this other woman and I are under the control of Joan Collins. I don't know why. We're so afraid of her that we will do whatever she tells us. She tells us that it's time to go have sex again. Something happens to interrupt us and the man and Joan Collins and the other woman walk away and I am talking to Paulette W. We're getting dressed and washing up and talking about how horrible this is and how much we don't want to do this. We decide to get dressed hurriedly and try to get out of there before she comes back so she can't find us. I'm not quite dressed and we here her coming. So I just grab my clothes and we take off running for the elevator. We realize that we don't have time to make it to the elevator so we run into a bathroom. We each go into a stall and close the door but we stand on the toilet so they can't see our feet. Someone, and I don't know if it is one of us or someone else, is actually going to the bathroom when they come in looking for us. They obviously don't see us because we are standing on the toilets and can't see our fit or anything.

1680,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,293,2001-09-28,"I was in Las Vegas. I got to my room and dropped off my things. I put on my teal wool suit and headed down to the casino. I was walking through the casino when I saw Diane S and her dad. I stopped and said hello. We were both very surprised to see each other. I asked her why she was there and she said for fun and vacation. I told her I was there for work. We chatted a little bit about Vegas and told her that I had been there just a year or so ago. She said her and her mom love to go out to the beach. I told her that the last time I was there I only got outside for an hour the whole time I was there because I was there for a conference. I didn't know if I was going to have time for fun this time either. I told her it was nice chatting with her but I needed to meet my colleagues. As I was walking through the casino I was walking through all of these different rooms. In each room there was a group of people celebrating a certain college. Each room was a different college and it was parents and family of these college students. As I was going through one of them, someone handed me a cake and asked me to carry it to housekeeping for them. I don't know why I said yes, but I did. I carried it for a little while and finally ran into someone that worked there and told them what happened. She took it from me. So then I went on, I was going to go back to my room and realized that I had forgotten my room number again. I said, now, this is ridiculous. I have had enough dreams where I have forgotten my room number, that I should be very careful about that when I come to a hotel. So, I went up to the front and I stood in line and I was going to ask them what my room number was. I also thought I didn't have my room number with me so I though I was going to have to ask housekeeping to go up with me and let me in. Then I found my key in my pocket. Obviously it had my room number on it. So I went to the bank of elevators and I just barely caught one. She pointed out what floor numbers is what and I said yes, this is the right one. But then as soon as the door closed and we started to move I realized that it wasn't the right one. It was another of these elevators that move side-to-side instead of up and down. It kind of rolled on these tracks outside of the building. When it stopped I got off. I realized I was in the wrong place but there were no other elevators there for me to get to my room. I was on this thing kind of like a bus but it was just an employee and me. She didn't know how to tell me to get to the elevator that I needed. She finally called someone to come and meet me. As I was waiting there, these tons of people, like a convention. they were all together. I was feeling very uncomfortable in this crowd of people. So I kept moving different places to try to find a good place to stand. Now I think I was driving. And now it seems that I am alone. I was talking to someone on a walkie-talkie. They were trying to give me directions. I was trying to turn around and I pulled up behind this police car. As I did I realized it was a female police office and she was starting to back up. Unfortunately, she didn't see me in time. And then I backed up and turned around and got out and was waiting for this person. I heard someone yelling my name.

For some reason, one night they were in bed already and I tucked the sheets and blankets in all along my edge of the bed before getting in. I then was having a lot of difficulty getting under the blankets, while they just lay there and watched. Someone else came in the room and said something and then left. Later we were in the airport going home. Actually I think I was in my home airport but it didn't look like it, but several others that I was traveling with were there too, although they aren't from Indy. We were having trouble figuring out where we needed to go. All we kept seeing were restaurants and retail businesses. We went up some escalators and then back down. We finally found out that we needed to go to the ticket counter to get baggage claim tickets. We got in line. There were four of us. I was first in line. When it came my turn they all pushed their way in front of me. I was aggravated by that. At first the ticket counters were very high so you could barely see the people working behind them. When I finally did get to the counter I asked how that had happened and she didn't have an answer for me. While she was taking care of me a group of young girls clamored around the counter pushing me out of the way. Then I got upset again and said something. They felt I was getting upset for no reason but moved a little bit to allow me back to the counter. the counter was the height of a normal airline counter. I left the counter and headed for my car. Oddly I had just one small bag on a portable luggage carrier. I struggled a bit getting the carrier up the escalator. I was in a hurry so I was trying to walk up the escalator rather than just riding it up at it's own pace. I was following a man who was doing the same thing. It felt like someone behind me was watching me critically. It seems that there was more to this dream about steps and escalators but I don't remember the details. I went outside to find my car. It was dark and I couldn't remember where I parked. I wondered if I had written it down on something in my bag but for some reason I was stopping to look. I thought I was fortunate that it wasn't a big parking lot, so I just kept wandering around looking for my car. I encountered a man, maybe two men, in the parking lot who said something to me. just being friendly. The parking lot was on the slant of a hill and there was lots of dirt and grass around.

I wasn't getting my workout done at all. One in particular that I talked to most. His son was there too. I think I left came back. There were a lot of women there. It seems that they were all nuns, women from CIIS, and BJ. One or two of my CRHP sisters were there as I was going in. I had asked this one woman help me to learn how to use the Stairmaster. She wasn't sure how to use it but showed me. She fed this yarn into the Stairmaster because it would do some kind of knitting as you were using it. So she fed this in and it was feeding out this long piece of knitted yarn. It was very irregular and uneven and it came out very fast. I said well, it's very uneven and irregular. It doesn't really matter because it isn't something I want or need anyway. I was still having trouble using the machine. Then I was looking for someone else to teach me how to use it right. There were two machines there.

1685,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,298,2001-10-02,"I was at a class reunion. I don't remember many of the people that were there. I do remember Susan J, Jake G and Darren. We were sitting in what appeared to be an old house at a large wood oval dining room table. We were just chatting and catching up and were laughing a lot. As more people began showing up we were looking for the other leafs of the table to add in so we could all sit around one table. We thought that everyone who would show up would fit around this one table. We thought that would be really nice to be able to do that. We all started getting up and pulling the table apart. We decided to pull it into another room so we would have room to expand it more. Then we decided to take some of the two-person square tables and put them at the end of this oval table and just keep making it longer and longer by adding those. So we started moving those in. Some of them were a bit taller than others so we tried to keep all those together at the end. As we were putting the square ones next to the oval ones, I was talking to someone and Jake G. We were talking about our little radio or TV program that we had done together. I said something about something that he had messed up. He admitted it. We were kind of laughing about it. I couldn't remember exactly what it was. I said, well, I did too. It wasn't anything critical, just nice memories. I was standing there looking at him thinking that he was as attractive now as ever, except that he was much nicer now. I was looking for a place to sit and I didn't want to sit next to Darren again as I was before we moved the table. It looked like there weren't any seats left. As I was walking around the table looking for a spot to sit, and I wanted to sit next to someone I knew fairly well, I walked behind Susan J and I rubbed her back. I was going to say something and my eyes started tearing. I though dang it, I don't want to cry. This is ridiculous. She looked at me and said what? I said, I wanted to say something but my eyes started tearing up. Several people started laughing. I sat on a ledge behind them. I said, I'm just like my dad. I was kind of joking but I started crying a little bit too. Then I just started laughing uncontrollably. I hid my face trying to compose myself. What I was thinking that I wanted to say was that I had been looking through my old autograph books and I was going to say that I had been doing that and I found something that she had written. I was very touched by it and that is what was making me want to cry.",class reunion remember many people remember susan jake darren sit appear old house large wood oval din room table chat catch laugh lot people begin show look leafs table add could sit around one table think everyone would show would fit around one table thought would really nice able start get pull table apart decide pull another room would room expand decide take two person square table put end oval table keep making longer longer add start move bit tall others try keep together end put square one next oval one talk someone jake talk little radio tv program together say something something mess admit kind laugh remember exactly say well anything critical nice memory stand look think attractive ever except much nicer look place sit want sit next darren move table look like seat leave walk around table look spot sit want sit next someone know fairly well walk behind susan rub back go say something eye start tear though dang want cry ridiculous look say say want say something eye start tear several people start laugh sat ledge behind say like dad kind joke start cry little bit start laugh uncontrollably hide face try compose think want say look old autograph book go say find something write touch make want cry,13.480579,13.445522,514,1,2,1,0,3,2,0,5,4,9,2
1686,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,299,2001-10-03,"I was sharing a bedroom and a bed, though not intimately, with Darren again. But we had not been intimate. We were trying to go to sleep. He kept rubbing up against me and I kept get irritated. He got upset. I said, Oh, Darren, I'm just PMS'ing. He rolled over and then he brushed up against me again. This time I got really upset and said Darren, will you please quit touching me? So he got mad and got out of bed and was pacing around. He was saying that this just couldn't keep going like this. I was noticing that the room was really a mess because he was so messy. I finally got out of bed and said, you're right. This can't keep going like this. I knew this wasn't going to work. We just need to end this. We are at some kind of family gathering with his family. We are looking through some pictures. I don't think we had told them yet that we were going to divorce again, or divorce, I don't' know. We were looking at pictures. There were some pictures with me in them. There were some other people there besides just his family. I found some pictures in there of Shirley J when she was a baby and I started pulling those out and showing them to Shirley J and kind of detracting people's attention I guess is what I was trying to do. I finally pulled out a couple of pictures of me. I guess we were supposed to be picking out a couple of pictures of me for some reason. I pulled a couple out finally and passed them around. There was one that a couple of people said they really liked and I just shook my head no. I said I just hate pictures of my self. They said oh, people usually do, but these are really good. Matt O. was there. I can't get back what he was doing there. Shirley J was asking if Darren and I were both at her house with her open windows if we would be able to keep an eye out for someone looking in. I said, Shirley J, that would be next to impossible with all the windows you have in that house. She said, yeah, she knew it would be pretty difficult and she probably needed to think about getting something to cover the windows. We talked about that a little bit. About how expensive that would be to cover all those windows. And She has so many patio doors in that house. I said one thing you could do that would be really inexpensive is what I did in my office. I just used a sheet. She looked at me quizzically. I said I just folded the sheet in half lengthwise and used thumbtacks and put it up there. She said that must have been a really long window. I said the sheet hangs behind the desk so you can't see how long the sheet is. Besides, that would be a really easy thing to hem up. I said, the other thing you could do is a rod pocket. She didn't know what I meant by that. So I went to one window where she did have a curtain hanging. I said, just like this. Just take the rod like this and feed it through one end of the sheet and just hanging it that way. I said it would be a little more expensive because you would need to buy curtain rods. And you would still need the sheets. But it would look a little better than hanging it with thumbtacks. When I was pointing to the rod there was no curtain on it, just the rod. And either Daddy or Bill F or someone did something at the other end and made the rod come loose and then it wouldn't go back right. They weren't helping me to get it back right so I was trying to do it myself. I finally got it back. Darren came up and did something. The next thing I know there is this table and the rod had come all apart and there were all of these screws and pieces and the rod had fallen apart. I was so aggravated that someone had done that. We were going to put it back together. I said, first we have to separate all these out by size so we know what goes where.",share bedroom bed though intimately darren intimate try go sleep kept rub keep get irritated get upset say oh darren pms ing roll brush time get really upset say darren please quit touch get mad get bed pace around say keep go like notice room really mess messy finally get bed say right keep go like know go work need end kind family gather family look picture think tell yet go divorce divorce know look picture picture people besides family find picture shirley baby start pull show shirley kind detract people attention guess try finally pull couple picture guess suppose pick couple picture reason pull couple finally pass around one couple people say really like shook head say hate picture self say oh people usually really good matt get back shirley ask darren house open window would able keep eye someone look say shirley would next impossible window house say yeah knew would pretty difficult probably need think get something cover windows talk little bit expensive would cover window many patio door house say one thing could would really inexpensive office use sheet look quizzically say folded sheet half lengthwise use thumbtack put say must really long window say sheet hang behind desk see long sheet besides would really easy thing hem say thing could rod pocket know mean go one window curtain hang say like take rod like fee one end sheet hang way say would little expensive would need buy curtain rod would still need sheet would look little well hang thumbtack point rod curtain rod either daddy bill someone something end make rod come loose go back right help get back right try finally get back darren come something next thing know table rod come apart screws piece rod fall apart aggravate someone go put back together say first separate size know go,13.887731,13.797632,765,6,7,7,7,8,6,4,9,10,11,2
1687,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,300,2001-10-04,"In the center of the mall they had these elaborate Christmas displays. This one woman went, inside one of them were her children. One of her daughters broke a ceramic doll and she was very upset and saying something like what did I do or what can I do. The next thing I knew the mother told her that she needed paint this line down the center of the mall to make up for what she did. She had this colored paint and a very thin artist brush. She was painting this very thin line down the center of the mall. I continued walking around trying to figure out where I needed to go to get to. I was looking for maybe the Van Maur store. I thought maybe that is where I needed to go to find my car. I kept walking back and forth trying to figure out how to get there. This man was out in the mall, working. I'm trying to remember what he was doing. I talked to him and I recognized his voice. He was talking into a microphone but talking to me at the same time. I finally said, oh, Jerry Curtis. He looked at me like I had it wrong. Then he said, Never and he told me his name. I said oh, you're on in the evening. I am so sorry. I listen to you all the time. He smiled at me and kept talking on his microphone. He shook my hand. I said I listen to you while I study. He kind of made this joking, funny face, like while you study? I finally made my way, well as I was trying to make my way to the parking garage I ran into some other people who were also headed for their car. They didn't know where they were parked either. We were talking about how we were supposed to find our cars around this mall and how this mall should do something to make it easier for people to remember where they parked and to find their car. I went outside and there was one couple and another woman. The one couple went out into the parking lot and came back. They were arguing. This other woman didn't have a clue where to begin to look for our cars. we are in kind of a tram. We're watching these kids play some kind of sport that I had never seen before. I asked someone what it was. They answered me but I didn't understand what they said. I was sitting in the second row with another woman and a couple of kids. The tram stopped so the kids could get out and get in the front row with their friends. We were watching this game.

1691,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,304,2001-10-04,"I came into a store and both sides of the aisle were lined with fans. The shelves were full of fans. There was a teenage boy working there. I laid my purse down on one of the shelves and headed into the back room. Now it was a bakery. I think it started out as just me, but then it was two other women and me. We were climbing around on top of these huge piles of boxes. It didn't seem like boxes though because we weren't hurting them and in some places it was kind of soft like they were cushions. I don't know how to describe it. It didn't seem that we were climbing around on boxes of baked goods at this point. And we were up there because we were supposed to be to do our jobs. One employee came up to me with this basket of bath and shower products. She asked me if I had tried these different things. She pulled one out and was rubbing it into my arms. Then she pulled out another one and I said no again. I said why don't you try that one on my legs. Then she pulled out another one and asked me if I have tried it. I say no again. She put that one on my back. She straddled me to rub it into my back. There were some kind of metal things coming down from the ceiling. Something about murder. She kept trying different things and I kept saying no. And one hurt and I said, no, no. That hurt. Then we heard an alarm or something and they said, oh, it's time for the kids. They are supposed to be here at 6:00. We all started jumping down to the floor. Started dropping all these toys that were kind of like stuffed animals but not really. They were just really soft toys. So we're picking up the toys and tossing them to the children as they come in. After all the children were in we started playing with them. Now, all these toys had pull cords and would say different things. Most of them were animals now and looked like typical stuffed animals, like a polar bear. rhinoceros. They were all lying on their stomachs. When the store was still a bakery, we were sneaking pieces of pies and cake. We weren't supposed to take anything home with us. I dropped a partially eaten pie into an empty box. That was somebody else's. There were two or three different boxes or bags like that. I was going to sneak them out of the store. When I was doing that a manager came along and he was looking for something and I thought I was going to get caught. He moved the boxes and didn't see what was in them and then he moved them back into the trash pile. I picked them up and took them out with me.

1693,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,306,2001-10-15,"I was on a TV show like Real People. I was hoping that for the next gig, I would get voted by the producers to go, because I knew that everyone would get to go. The men especially seemed to enjoy having me around. This place that we were staying was awesome. It was four floors and no elevators. But there is no way to describe it. So unusual. So awesome. I was cleaning up the kitchen and complaining because not enough people clean up the kitchen. The men came in and were all dressed up, they looked kind of like tuxes. Some of them had gold pants on. Some of them had black tuxedo pants. A couple of them weren't dressed yet and I went to get my camera so I could take a picture of them all dressed up. They told me I could take a picture afterwards. One of the men didn't have any pants. I went upstairs and I called down. the middle of the building was open from the first floor to the fourth. I called down and told him to come up. Several of them came up. They were laughing and telling me that it was just a joke and they were just teasing me. I got kind of mad at them but they apologized. We went back downstairs and they all took off and told me I could take a picture when they got back. When they got back they weren't dressed up anymore so I didn't get to take my picture anyway. There was one part of this house that was like a huge circular theater. It was so awesome. I can't possibly describe it and do it justice. The seats and decor was mostly red. Behind the last row of seats were all of these Christmas displays. It was soooo cool. There were many different alcoves with arched tops and lit inside and each one had a Christmas display. They wanted me to fix it all up and make it usable again so people would come in and use it again and appreciate it again. Some moving men came. There were these big things, taller than me, flat, magnetic, looked like toy soldiers maybe. These moving men came to pick all these things up and move them somewhere. I was helping them get these things loaded up on their truck. After they left there was quite a bit of extra space. Santa Claus and his wife came in and gave this to me. It was so incredible. They wanted me to fix it up. Mr. and Mrs. Claus and another couple were being lifted into the sky to heaven. It was like they had died but they didn't have to have the typical funeral and everything. They were just being lifted into heaven. Someone came up to me and I said they died and they didn't believe me. I told them what had happened and that this space had been given to me. We started rushing around looking at all the displays and looking at all the neat stuff. In one of the alcoves, Santa had told me he wanted me to set it up kind of like an electric train village. We were looking at all these things and talking about how to move these things around and display them. I was so excited I couldn't wait to get started. Then there was this huge old-fashioned pipe organ that I was playing. All the people I was living with were there. There was some kind of a concert or something going on. I read a poem that I wrote. There was a female singer. We had several women all dressed like her standing in different places and we would put the spotlight on them one at a time so it looked like she was magically moving from one place to the next. It was a soft green spotlight. At one point it was me. I was lying on my side on a couple of seats and I just kept rolling over and over. I rolled over some of the men. I was kissing some of them. Some of them were kind of hiding. They were all a lot younger than I was. I brushed my cheek against one of them and told him how soft his skin was. He seemed to really like that. One of them had part of his stomach showing from his shirt and I leaned down and kissed his stomach. I was being a little bit of a tease. Some of them got up and we were dancing. The music was out of control and there were tons of people in there. There was a bunch of black women. One of them was Audrey T. Another said you should have told us not to bring our purses in, and things like this. We finally got all of these people out and got some control back. When Santa first gave me this place I was showing some people around and we were looking at things. Before Santa had left he had pulled some things out of closets like a sleigh full of things and a rocking chair full of things and just different things like that. Some of the men had come back and were showing me their grades and saying that their grades were good enough that they were good choices to help me refurbish this place for having shows, and tours, and letting people see these wonderful Christmas displays.",tv show like real people hop next gig would get voted producer go know everyone would get go men especially seem enjoy around place stay awesome four floor elevator way describe unusual awesome clean kitchen complain enough people clean kitchen men come dress look kind like tux gold pant black tuxedo pant couple dress yet go get camera could take picture dress tell could take picture afterwards one men pant go upstairs call middle building open first floor fourth call tell come several come laugh tell joke tease get kind mad apologize go back downstairs take told could take picture get back get back dress anymore get take picture anyway one part house like huge circular theater awesome possibly describe justice seat decor mostly red behind last row seat christmas display soooo cool many different alcove arch top light inside one christmas display want fix make usable people would come use appreciate move men come big thing taller flat magnetic look like toy soldier maybe move men come pick thing move somewhere help get thing load truck leave quite bit extra space santa claus wife come give incredible want fix mr mr claus another couple lift sky heaven like die typical funeral everything lift heaven someone come say die believe tell happen space give start rush around look display look neat stuff one alcoves santa tell want set kind like electric train village look thing talk move thing around display excite wait get start huge old fashion pipe organ play people live kind concert something go read poem write female singer several woman dress like stand different place would put spotlight one time look like magically move one place next soft green spotlight one point lie side couple seat keep roll roll men kiss kind hiding lot young brush cheek one tell soft skin seem really like one part stomach show shirt lean kiss stomach little bit tease get dance music control ton people bunch black woman one audrey another say tell u bring purse thing like finally get people get control back santa first give place show people around look thing santa leave pull thing closet like sleigh full thing rock chair full thing different thing like men come back show grade say grade good enough good choice help refurbish place show tour let people see wonderful christmas display,14.125184,13.380803,933,5,8,4,3,12,5,5,12,8,25,2
1694,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,307,2001-10-16,"Chris A Charging me $5500. Matthew doing drugs. Daddy asked Chris A what we owed him for towing my car to St. Joe. He said something jokingly and then with a look like I don't know how you are going to react to this he said $5500. He was totally serious. Daddy hesitated, shocked of course, and then said, well, if that's what we owe, then I'll take care of it. I was so upset. I went back to the house with Daddy. Mother was there. BJ was there too. I didn't let her know how upset I was. After she left, I tried to talk to Mother. I was so upset I couldn't speak. I tried but she could hardly hear the words. I told her what had happened. I said if I had known that I never would have had him tow it. That I wouldn't have paid that kind of money to do anything for that car. The car itself isn't even worth a fifth of that. I was so, so upset. Mother just sat and listened sympathetically. There wasn't much either of us could do. I told her that I tried to call Chris A and heard a message that BJ had left for him apologizing to him that Daddy had not offered to pay his gas money. This made me even more furious and I told Mother about that. I left and went to see Matthew at PLU. I walked. I found Matthew sitting, leaning back, on a cement step shaped sitting area. It was a kind of laid back, I don't care about anything I'm cool posture. I asked him how things were going. How classes were going. He said college is very cool but classes aren't going so well. I'm not sure how I got to this but he admitted to doing what he called the experimental drugs. I tried to stay calm and asked him which ones those were. He said sugar, marijuana, and something I didn't recognize. hadn't heard before. I was terribly upset. I crouched down in front of him and begged him not to do it again. I tried to remind him how dangerous it is. He continued with his casual carefree attitude. I asked him if Chris H did them too. He said no. I asked him what Chris H said about him doing them. He said Chris H asked him something like what the high is in it. As we were sitting there I saw Mother and Daddy drive by in a cute, blue convertible. I realized they must be test driving it for me. I pointed it out to Matthew but they were gone by the time he looked. A little bit later they drove by again, this time with the top up but it looked like a hard top now. I pointed them out quickly and he saw them this time. I said something about it being a cute little car. I was so distraught about the drugs that I got up and walked away. Matthew didn't say anything. I came past the campus again as I was walking home and say Mother and Daddy standing there talking to Matthew. At first I was going to walk on by but then decided to go join them. I didn't say anything to Matthew. Mother and Daddy were saying something about what a good young man Matthew is and something else. I wanted to say, this is not the grandson you knew. This is not the grandson that goes to church on Sundays, etc. But I didn't. I got very upset again and just walked away. Mother and Daddy followed me. I was in tears. Again, I couldn't speak. As we were walking away Matthew called out to me Mom, didn't you forget something. I kept walking because this was not the son I knew. Then I heard, Mommie. Mommie.

I looked at mine and noticed that I was first in the class for grades for our football segment. I felt that was an extreme accomplishment. Partially because I hate football and partially because I don't know that I have ever been ranked first in my class for anything. Diane S said that she was second in the class. I didn't say anything to my classmates. I ran into the house where Bob F was in the living room watching TV. I showed him my report card. We were all sitting in the yard of my birth home. I was so excited that my hand was shaking as I pointed to the football ranking. He didn't say anything but simply pulled out his report card to show me that he had ranked first in several of his classes. I was very upset by this-that not only could he recognize and appreciate my accomplishment, but that it was just more of the same.

1696,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,309,2001-10-16,"I was in my apartment with Mother and some other members of my family that I cannot identify. It was not my waking life apartment. Something had happened that I realized this was a perfect opportunity to make some major furnishing changes in my apartment. I was going to switch the living room with the dining room for one thing. Currently in the dream home, the front door led directly into the dining room. Matthew had already hung curtains so I realized they were going to need to be switched as well. Matthew had arrived home from a visit with his Dad and the apartment was filled to capacity, little floor space left, with old furniture. I found out that Grandma and Grandpa Ho had intended to get rid of all this stuff and Matthew thought I might want some of it because of my interest in antiques and old furniture. So they sent it all with him, with the instructions for me to do whatever with the things I didn't want. There was a lot I didn't want and obviously didn't have room for all of it either. I still wanted to make the switch of the two rooms but now could not even find my original furnishings. At this point there were many other people there, most that I didn't know, and some were Harris family members. I believe BJ and Bev might have been there also. Everyone pitched in and began helping me to clear the place out by eliminating the items I didn't want. Now the apartment had a basement garage so we were taking these things through the stairwell into that space. Bob F was one of the men down there taking things from the people working upstairs. At some point I realized that a lot of the people who were helping were from a not-for-profit group and I was going to donate all of the things I didn't want to them. It almost felt as if things were multiplying because I kept finding more and more stuff that I hadn't realized was there before. There were several old sofas and big easy chairs. There were quite a few huge wood pieces, such as wall units, or bookshelf kind of things. Many of these were hideous looking in my opinion. They were very large, heavy and difficult to move. We were alternating our positions and jobs in clearing the place out. Some people wanted turns being at the top of the stairs. I mostly stood between the various rooms and the top of the stairs and kept pushing things toward the person at the top of the stairs. I would occasionally put things into the stair well myself. Sometimes just sitting things on the first landing and sometimes handing things down to men in the basement/garage. The stairwell had a few steps to the first landing, then turned left and went the rest of the way down. I had taken something with two legs that I thought was very light and not dangerous and just kind of pushed it down. I realized after I let go that one of the legs hit someone in the head. Instead of saying anything I walked away. As I did so I knew I should go back and acknowledge what I did and apologize but I was too embarrassed and for some reason afraid to. Then I heard people talking loudly and criticizing what had happened. The man was bleeding but I don't know how badly. Someone thought he might need stitches but most thought that person was overreacting. I never did go and admit what I had done. This was taking much longer than people had thought it would. Many of us were beginning to get hungry. I went and asked Daddy if I should order dinner to be delivered. I don't remember him answering me then but I didn't do it. At the time I thought I didn't need his permission to do that if I'm going to pay for it myself. Maybe I thought if I asked him he would offer to pay. In waking life I know he would. For whatever reason we didn't order dinner and we kept working. The Harris family members that were there had been there for another reason and had not expected to stay so long. Even when they decided to stay and help with this new situation they didn't realize it would take so long. I don't think any of us did. They were particularly hungry. I kept thinking about how Darren and Matthew got all of this stuff here and how I could have been unaware of them bringing all of this stuff into the apartment when it had to have taken them a good deal of time. BJ and Bev kept identifying items that they thought I would want to keep. One of them found a beautiful bedroom suit. It was white with a pastel flower design/fabric on parts of it. I said that I absolutely wanted to keep that. In waking life I have wanted a new bedroom suit for almost 20 years, but can never seem to afford it. They and we found quite a few really great furniture items, artwork, two really great desks. one that I would keep in the kitchen and one for my office, other decorative items. Some of the artwork seemed very contemporary and colorful. In fact, there was an artist there painting a piece similar to several that were already there. I felt bad that he saw me deciding to give them away. I kind of liked them but not enough to keep them in light of everything I had there. At some point the scene shifted and we were still in the same apartment but it now seemed as though we were clearing out the remnants of someone who used to live there for us to move in. There were things hanging on the walls that needed to be removed. Some things I would decide to keep and either not remove or rehang after thinking about it. In the kitchen there were cabinets full of white/see-through plastic containers and I gave away the containers and everything. There were also quite a few small wooden cabinets for lack of a better word, that had lots of little compartments and such. They were each made to house certain types of items. I had removed one from the wall, examined it carefully, and then replaced it deciding to keep it. I then decided to keep all of the similar ones. There were also two or more refrigerators. They had containers in them but no food. I gave away all but one of them, containers and all. The one I kept seemed to fit nicely into a kitchen cove. It was smaller than a conventional home refrigerator and it was brown. As we continued to clear things out I decided to put all of the artwork in one place together and I would not go through it until after I had the furniture I wanted and placed where I wanted it. Then I could better decide which artwork I wanted to keep and had the space to hang. There was a lot of artwork and I really liked most of it. We continued to try to find the living room and dining room pieces that I wanted to keep and get them placed where I wanted them. I wanted to gather the pieces into the appropriate room and then have Mother help me decided where to place things for the best aesthetic results. For some reason I was focusing on completing the dining room first, but was definitely focused on the living room second. we thought we were almost done and then realized that my bedroom was still full so we began working on it. Then we thought we were almost done and we realized the kitchen was still full. In working on emptying the kitchen I noticed all of the things hanging on the walls that needed to be removed. I removed some of them but asked others to help with that. I went into the bedroom and began selectively taking things off the walls. I kept the religious items that were there and some of the lighting fixtures/lamps. The only thing in particular that I remember hanging in the kitchen, though I remember there were a lot of things hanging, is a small yarn thing that reminded me of a miniature flower holder that was popular maybe twenty years ago. People were beginning to complain more and more about how hungry they were. I finally decided to go ahead and order pizza. One man pulled a bunch of pizza coupons out of his pocket. They offered two medium pizzas for $9.99. I asked someone to call in an order and just order a variety of different kinds. There were a lot of people there so they needed to figure out how many to order. There were a lot of wicker decorative items. Some of them were basket like in nature and I would put things from the walls in them. Some of the huge wood wall units still had many items sitting on the shelves. We were moving them with the things still in place. I have no idea how those things did not fall off. I was always glad when I could push a piece onto an area rug and move it along with no problem. Some of the things were oddly shaped and we had to figure out how to get them down the L-shaped stairwell. Some were extremely heavy. Some that I thought would be really heavy I would see one or two men hoist above their heads and carry them out. Some large items were so light I could lift them with one hand and push them down the stairs myself, even some of the large, stuffed chairs.",apartment mother member family identify wake life apartment something happen realize perfect opportunity make major furnish change apartment go switch living room din room one thing currently dream home front door lead directly din room matthew already hang curtain realize go need switch well matthew arrive home visit dad apartment fill capacity little floor space leave old furniture find grandma grandpa ho intend get rid stuff matthew think might want interest antique old furniture send instruction whatever thing want lot want obviously room either still want make switch two room could even find original furnish point many people know harris family member believe bj bev might also everyone pitch begin help clear place eliminate item want apartment basement garage take thing stairwell space bob one men take thing people work upstairs point realize lot people help profit group go donate thing want almost felt thing multiply keep find stuff realize several old sofa big easy chair quite huge wood piece wall unit bookshelf kind thing many hideous look opinion large heavy difficult move alternate position job clear place people want turn top stair mostly stand various room top stair keep push thing toward person top stair would occasionally put thing stair well sometimes sit thing first land sometimes hand thing men basement garage stairwell step first land turn leave go rest way take something two legs think light dangerous kind push realize let go one leg hit someone head instead say anything walk away know go back acknowledge apologize embarrass reason afraid heard people talk loudly criticize happen man bleed know badly someone think might need stitch think person overreact never go admit take much long people think would many u begin get hungry go ask daddy order dinner deliver remember answering time think need permission go pay maybe think ask would offer pay wake life know would whatever reason order dinner keep work harris family member another reason expect stay long even decide stay help new situation realize would take long think u particularly hungry keep think darren matthew get stuff could unaware bring stuff apartment take good deal time bj bev keep identify item think would want keep one find beautiful bedroom suit white pastel flower design fabric part say absolutely wanted keep wake life want new bedroom suit almost year never seem afford find quite really great furniture item artwork two really great desk one would keep kitchen one office decorative item artwork seem contemporary colorful fact artist paint piece similar several already felt bad saw decide give away kind liked enough keep light everything point scene shift still apartment seem though clearing remnant someone use live u move thing hang wall need remove thing would decide keep either remove rehang think kitchen cabinet full white see plastic container give away container everything also quite small wooden cabinet lack good word lot little compartment make house certain type item remove one wall examine carefully replace decide keep decide keep similar one also two refrigerator container food give away one container one kept seem fit nicely kitchen cove small conventional home refrigerator brown continue clear thing decide put artwork one place together would go furniture want place want could better decide artwork want keep space hang lot artwork really like continue try find living room din room piece want keep get place want want gather piece appropriate room mother help decide place thing best aesthetic result reason focus complete din room first definitely focused living room second think almost realize bedroom still full begin work think almost realize kitchen still full work empty kitchen notice thing hang wall need remove remove ask others help go bedroom begin selectively take thing wall keep religious item light fixture lamps thing particular remember hang kitchen though remember lot thing hang small yarn thing remind miniature flower holder popular maybe twenty year ago people begin complain hungry finally decide go ahead order pizza one man pull bunch pizza coupon pocket offer two medium pizza ask someone call order order variety different kind lot people need figure many order lot wicker decorative item basket like nature would put thing wall huge wood wall unit still many item sit shelf move thing still place idea thing fall always glad could push piece onto area rug move along problem thing oddly shape figure get shape stairwell extremely heavy thought would really heavy would see one two men hoist head carry large item light could lift one hand push stairs even large stuffed chair,13.827231,13.619824,1686,5,19,6,10,14,11,3,15,17,33,2

1699,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,312,2001-10-17,"I went to a Kroger store to get my prescription for Concerta filled. I was talking to them about it. I told them that I used to work for People's Drug Stores and from that experience I knew that different stores in one chain would have different prices on items depending on their location. I wondered if that was the same for them and their prescriptions. At first he acted like he didn't want to tell me then he kind of nonchalantly acted like he didn't know. I had the feeling that he did know but he didn't want to tell me. I was walking around the store waiting for my prescription to be filled. It was a very small store for a Kroger store. It was more the size of a drug store. They were telling other people that I used to work for People's Drug Stores. They introduced me to one man in particular, but I can't remember why they introduced me to him or who he was or what his role was. My prescription was finally ready and I went to pick it up and it was over $200. I said, Oh, wait a minute. When I came to get it filled the last time it was only $125. Of course, that was a different store. I can't do this. I've been unemployed for the last year. I've been having enough trouble getting this as it is. They took it back. I went to get a bottle of Diet Sprite before I left. I realized I didn't have my purse with me so I put it back on the shelf and went out to my car to get my money. I saw my purse and my car keys laying on the seat and the door was locked. I was so angry. I went back in and they called AAA for me. While I was waiting they were having a company meeting so I just sat with them during their meeting. I kept watching out the window for AAA to arrive. They were going around the tables and talking about each person or having each person say something. I didn't think they would make me speak since I was not a part of their group, and they didn't. They passed by me. I saw AAA come so I ran out quickly. As I got out there I realized that my car keys were in my pocket. And AAA was actually a woman driving a mini-van. When I got out there and realized that I had my keys she was out of the van and lifting the rear door up to get ready to help me. I apologized for having called her out there for nothing. She didn't seem upset, like it wasn't a big deal.

They didn't know quite what to think. Many of my siblings and in-laws were there with their children. But the children were much younger and not in the same chronological age order, or not represented as such by size, than in waking life. The first time I realized that I was lucid is when Chris A was just a baby and Matthew was about three times his size. I said, Hey, you men this is a dream! They all looked at me kind of funny, not quite sure how to respond. I said you can tell because look at the difference in sizes between Chris A and Matthew. Chris A is significantly older than Matthew is and it should be the other way around. I don't know if we are all having this dream or if it is simply that I am lucid, but this is definitely a lucid dream. We went about what we were doing, changing diapers, working in the kitchen, eating cookies and such. Mari Kate S had curlers in her hair and was very small.

1702,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,315,2001-10-26,"I was going to work for Brad S and I had taken some hamburger with me to take home after I got off work. I put it in one of the desk drawers hoping that he wouldn't see it before we left. In his office there were two desks. His was sitting facing the door and the other was sitting at an angle facing his. I was sitting at the other desk. I don't remember what I was doing. As usual, there wasn't much to do. There were several people in there. I noticed my desk had stuff all over it just like his usually is in waking life, especially a bunch of pens. I start picking up these pens and testing them. A lot of them didn't write any longer so I threw them away. I thought to myself, why didn't he do that. Someone then asked me the same thing. I was trying to be nice and just said I don't know. He brought some new insurance man in to introduce to me. I was trying to be nice. I don't remember what kind of insurance he was selling. I told him I was satisfied with my current insurance policies. After all those people left, Susan J and Theresa Ay came in. I found that Susan J was working for him part-time and one full day a week and that Theresa Ay was also working for him. I got really angry with him and thought, no wonder I'm not getting any hours. I took my stuff and left. I was going through all these doors and hallways trying to get out. I noticed that Brad S was following me. I kept walking as quickly as I could and taking all of these different turns hoping to lose him. I finally got outside and I started flying right away thinking that was the best way to get away from him. I did. I lost him. Everyone else that was flying was flapping their arms to fly. I kind of turned on my back and was just enjoying how good it felt. Amy S had invited me to a lunch. There were quite a few people there. The attire was dressy. We went to kind of a fancy restaurant but it was a very long table with all of the female friends of hers. She was the only person I knew. All of the things we were eating were kind of colorful molds of things. Some of them were Jell-O molds. Some had mini-marshmallows covering them. I mentioned to her what Brad S had done about the hours and how angry I was that he had done that to me. A couple of people questioned it because I was trying to defend my position then. I stated that when I interviewed I got the impression that we agreed to my working 12 to 4 or 5, Monday through Friday and the weekly hours would be between 20 and 25. I stated that it has never been that way since I started. The first week I got 18 hours, and it has declined each week after that, with last week being only 2 hours. I was getting so angry talking about it. I learned that Susan J and all of these women were part of office services for the building where Brad S rents. One woman left to find out what was going on and she came back and told us that. I said, you know that really doesn't matter to me. It still doesn't make it right that he told me one thing and didn't follow through. I said I'm sure he didn't realize that Susan J and I grew up together and were best friends for a lot of years. I went and talked to Susan J to see if she was in fact doing this specialized stuff that they said she was and if she wasn't then she was basically doing the same thing he had me doing when he did have me come in. At that point different people started showing up and making all kinds of accusations about people. It was getting ugly and embarrassing. Some people were just sitting there because they didn't know what to do or say. I just decided that I was going to leave. Again, it was a series of doors that I had to go through to leave. They were all glass and some of them were revolving doors. I finally managed to get out. My car was sitting right outside the final door. I jumped in and locked the doors so that even if they did follow me they couldn't get in. I started it and put it in gear. I was in a cobblestone courtyard. It was fairly open but it had three places that you could probably drive through. They looked somewhat like alleys. All these women were walking around in floor length pastel flowing dresses and they all had boas. Some of them were bright colors, but they all had boas. I went ahead and put my car in gear. I wondered how I was going to get out with these women walking around everywhere.

1703,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,316,2001-10-26,"I'm driving and now I have someone in the car with me. We're trying to get back home. We don't remember the way. It seems as though we are in Norton. We take a couple of turns hoping that we are headed in the right direction. Finally there is a very large African-American woman working on the front door of her house. She had her back to us. I finally decided to pull up anyway and asked her for directions. I just stopped on the road and she turned around. I asked and she gave me directions. She said, well, you're headed in the wrong direction to go to Indy. You need to go back the other way and go to that road and turn right? I didn't know what road she meant. She had turned back around and went back to her work on the door. We were going to turn around and head back, even though we still weren't sure of the directions. For some reason we stopped somewhere and we went inside. Maybe for something to drink. People are looking at us kind of strangely. We asked for directions again and someone points to a pile of papers, like glossy photos, sitting on a table. She said, your answer is in there. So we rushed over there and began going through them. We were lifting them up and laying them down as you would if you wanted to keep them in the right order. They were pictures of movie stars. The person with me knew all their names and she was really good at naming them very quickly. When we got to the bottom it was a wedding. I looked at it and realized it was this friend that was with me. I said look at this. Suddenly we noticed what she was wearing. She was wearing a wedding dress. We finally realized that she had run out of her wedding. So we were walking around this building. There were many rooms. Each one had an altar and a lot of them were decorated similarly. like there might have been a few basic themes that they used. One of them was like a flower arrangement sitting on some goblets and there was water flowing, kind of like a table top water fountain. I finally said, we have got to go. We have got to get out of here. We finally found this one room and there were people that we knew in there and people that knew she had run away and left her fiance at the altar. We were talking about how hungry we were. This one woman came up who had baked the cake. She was so sad and distraught because no one was going to enjoy her cake. She had made some other cakes for dessert as well. For some reason she said we could taste them as long as we didn't cut into them. Like we could taste, we should take some of the decorations off the top to taste. I asked her where the wedding cake was and told her I really wanted to see it. She took us to see it. It was three squares like Mother and Daddy's. She said, but don't touch the wedding cake. So, a couple of us lifted icing decorations off these smaller cakes and were eating those. Someone took them off the wedding cake also and was eating those. Then I realized that someone had actually cut into the cakes. We were picking up pieces of those cakes and eating them. Some of them were ice cream cakes. The fiance didn't seem to be very upset when he saw this. He was crouched down next to another woman at a table and talking to her. I with this friend of mine, who was the bride-to-be, to talk to them a bit. He didn't seem to be upset with her or anything. I told my friend that I thought he was attractive and asked her if she would mind if I went out with him.

1705,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,318,2001-10-27,"I get the feeling that I was at my birth home but the people there were people from CIIS and from the sleep center. We got word that this famous shoe designer was going to be there and was going to give us each a pair of shoes. When it was almost time for us to go in this room where she set up there was a lot of. Someone said there was no line so everyone was just kind of milling around. Then a couple of people started to form a line, so I got in that line quickly. A couple more people followed and so on. Someone else started another line so I moved over to that line and everyone followed. When they opened the door and let us in. At first they just let a couple of people in so I was one of those first few to go in. At first I thought there were just a couple of styles and all in white. I never wear white shoes. Then I realized the whole room was almost wall to wall shoes and several shelves high, different colors. White, pink, beige, navy, and black. There were some that had multi-colored gemstones and flowers and looked very gaudy to me. I couldn't decide and I was going around and around and around in this room. I suddenly realized that everyone else had chosen theirs and I still had not. While I was in there, Gill U came in. I wondered what he was doing there. I thought, why won't he leave me alone. I said hello and asked him what he was doing there. I told him this was a special event just for our company employees. He kind of blew it off a little bit and continued walking around. He said something but I don't remember what. Then he left. I noticed Doctor W and his wife were there. I didn't say anything to them. I pretended not to see them there. They didn't say anything to me so I don't know if they were doing the same thing or if they really didn't see me. Julie S came up to me. I was looking at one pair in particular. She said I see that you have the same taste in shoes as I do. I said, yes I do. As it was winding up the designer was there and said something to me. I told her what I was looking for but that I hadn't found it in my size. There was one style, pink and flat heels, that was called the president or presidential. I just noticed a couple more boxes of those that I hadn't seen previously so I quickly looked to see if my size was there, but it wasn't. So her and her employees were starting to pack up. I kept walking around the room and there were these other things that she had made and were hanging from peg hooks. Some of them were dream catchers. Someone said something about the dreamcatchers. I agreed that they were beautiful and told them that I do dreamwork. They said, really, you interpret dreams? I said, I help people interpret dreams. I said, I have a collection of dreamcatchers on my office wall at home. Some of the things hanging from the peg hooks I don't know what they were and am at a loss to even describe them. maybe similar to necklaces but I don't think that's what they were. We were sitting back in the living room. Karen M was sitting there and wanted to see what shoes I had chosen, but I didn't get any. I had come out with some things in my arms though. They must have been scarves. The designer had given me those in place of shoes. I told Karen M I didn't get any shoes and asked her what she got. She was showing me the things that she got.

1707,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,320,2001-10-27,"I went to see Alice S to ask her a couple of questions. I can't get a sense of the building I was in. Normally I would be either in the grade school, church offices, or in Shalom House. This was more like a very large, 3-4 story school or. It reminds me of Goodman Hall at SMW. I went into Alice S's office. It was very tiny and uncomfortable to me because it was so small and crowded. It had her desk and some shelves and filing cabinets, two sitting chairs with a table between them and another very small desk also. Alice S was in there. I had asked her something and she was printing a copy or getting a paper for me or for someone else. I'm not sure. The gentleman that works in her office at that very small desk was working at his laptop computer. His name was Scott. He closed it up and left. For some reason I had the sense that he wasn't going to be working there anymore. I asked Alice S what happened to Scott. She said, shh, like we shouldn't talk about it. I sat down in one of the chairs while I was waiting for her. She sat down at her desk and another man came in and started talking to her. He completely ignored me or didn't even see me there. He was standing right in front of me with his back to me and started asking her something. Then he left and a woman came in and actually closed the door behind her. She said, hi boss. Can I have ten minutes of your time? This was an older woman. She looked at me but completely ignored me and didn't say a word to me. Finally Alice S looked at me apologetically and said, would you mind? I said, why don't you give me one of your cards and I'll email you. My tone of voice showed my frustration. I was searching around her desk to pick up a card but I couldn't find one. She said, no, why don't you call me because I wouldn't want this to get lost among a bunch of emails. I said, fine again with the tone of voice. I was very perturbed that I had been there and these other people came in and ignored me and I was the one that kept getting put off. I went ahead and left. I was trying to find my way out of this building. There was also a young boy who seemed to be trying to find his way out as well. I don't know what happened to him as the dream progressed. I finally thought, if I go to the basement I will know my way from there. I went to the basement and then I started going up these escalators. They were not normal escalators but only 1/3 or _ as many steps as a normal one and they seemed to move a bit differently as well. These made me even more uncomfortable than the ones in waking life do. It was like you had to move especially quickly and carefully at the top to get off. I finally got up to this one floor and for some reason I got a wheelchair and was pushing it. I had to get through this one area and had these lines of people like you might see at a bank if there were many tellers and each had their own line. In every line there was at least one person sitting in a wheelchair and I had to get across the front of these people. Most of the people in the wheelchairs were being very nice about it. They had to back up a bit to make room for me to get through with this empty wheelchair. I kind of brushed up against a couple of them and apologized. I finally got through. For some reason it seems that I took the empty wheelchair just so I could get through. Someone asked me to take this woman in a hospital bed to her new room. She was being transferred to another room. I must have been at SVH. I realized later that I was. They didn't tell me what floor this woman needed to go to and she didn't know either. I stopped at this one place that was kind of like a snack bar window. I asked if they could make a call to find out where she was supposed to be. The manager was being very uncooperative. One of the male employees asked the manager if it was okay to offer the patient some free ice cream. He said that was fine and asked her if she would like some. She said yes so the employee gave her some vanilla soft serve ice cream in a cardboard bowl. I sat her up in her bed and she was eating her ice cream. While we were sitting there these younger adults came up. I thought I recognized the one woman but I didn't say anything. They were relatives of this woman in bed. They were surprised to see her and they chatted for a little while. Somewhere around this point she told me that she was fine and was actually there to do volunteer work. I don't know why she was in this hospital bed. I said, well, I'll tell you what though. Let's have you stay in the bed that way we will be able to get through these different floors without people questioning us. It will be easier for us to go through the various places in the hospital to find out where you are supposed to be. She agreed to that. I then said, let's start at the third floor because that makes most sense to me as far as a place to start. After she finished her ice cream and finished talking to her relatives I had her lay back down and I took her up to the 3rd floor. I went through a couple of departments and a couple of them said that this patient wasn't theirs. we went into this one area like a small pharmacy. I was having trouble maneuvering this bed around in there because the aisles were so narrow and short. While we were in there a doctor came running in yelling tube, tube, tube. He ran in a pulled a tube in a plastic wrapper off the shelf, ripped it open and just dropped the wrapper, and ran back out and down the hall. There were maybe 4 or 5 more doctors who came running down the hall towards us. They had blood all over them and some medical things in their hands. I thought they were running in to us. But I guess they decided they didn't need to. They calmed down and ran around and said yes he was breathing okay and the tube was clear. They went back and she had a concerned look on her face. I said don't worry, it will be okay. They won't have you volunteering any place that is really uncomfortable for you. The doctors that had blood all over them had splatter blood all over her face. I took a towel and gently wiped it off, I recall the most being on her forehead. We went on working our way to some departments trying to find where she was supposed to be. I came across a large male black nurse. I asked him if he could tell me where the admissions office is for this area. He told me where to go. I headed over there. I saw a nurse sitting by a desk. There was a very small newborn. maybe a preemie. next to her. I think it was in an incubator. She was on the phone. When she got off the phone I explained why we were there and that this woman was really fine. I had kept her on the bed so we could get through the various departments to find out where she was supposed to be. She was supposed to be volunteering. The nurse was very nice. She was a younger black female nurse. While we were waiting for her to get off the phone I was wondering if this was the new pediatric unit that SVH has been building, or if it was the new pediatric sleep center. At that point the nurse said the woman could get out of bed and she would take care of it from there. I could just take the bed out. I headed out with the empty bed and came across this male nurse again. He said he was on his way to put back another empty bed so I could just follow him. I jokingly said, oh, you were supposed to give me a ride now. He just laughed. He went really fast and I couldn't keep up with him so I was practically running to keep up with him. I guess staff thought I was playing with the empty bed or something because they were all looking at me and grinning. I saw Doctor C at the end of the hall so I aimed it at him like I was going to run into him. When I got up to him I stopped to say hello. His hair was completely gray. He spoke very briefly, but friendly. Just not what I expected after not seeing him for a year. I thought he would seem happier to see me. I just chalked it up to him being either very busy or in one of his moods. Either way this is how he would have acted so I didn't take it personally.",go see alice ask couple question get sense building normally would either grade school church office shalom house like large story school remind goodman hall smw go alice office tiny uncomfortable small crowd desk shelf file cabinet two sit chair table another small desk also alice ask something print copy get paper someone else sure gentleman work office small desk work laptop computer name scott close leave reason sense go work anymore ask alice happen scott say shh like talk sit one chair wait sit desk another man come start talk completely ignore even see stand right front back start ask something leave woman come actually close door behind say hi bos ten minute time old woman look completely ignore say word finally alice look apologetically say would mind say give one card email tone voice show frustration search around desk pick card find one say call want get lose among bunch email say fine tone voice perturb people come ignore one keep get put go ahead leave try find way building also young boy seem try find way well know happen dream progress finally think go basement know way go basement start go escalator normal escalator many step normal one seem move bit differently well make even uncomfortable one wake life like move especially quickly carefully top get finally get one floor reason get wheelchair push get one area line people like might see bank many teller line every line least one person sit wheelchair get across front people people wheelchairs nice back bit make room get empty wheelchair kind brush couple apologize finally get reason seem take empty wheelchair could get someone ask take woman hospital bed new room transfer another room must svh realize later tell floor woman need go know either stop one place kind like snack bar window ask could make call find supposed manager uncooperative one male employee ask manager okay offer patient free ice cream say fine ask would like say yes employee give vanilla soft serve ice cream cardboard bowl sit bed eat ice cream sit young adult come think recognize one woman say anything relative woman bed surprised see chat little somewhere around point tell fine actually volunteer work know hospital bed say well tell though let stay bed way able get different floor without people question u easy u go various place hospital find suppose agree say let start third floor make sense far place start finish ice cream finish talk relative lay back take floor go couple department couple say patient go one area like small pharmacy trouble maneuver bed around aisle narrow short doctor come run yell tube tube tube run pull tube plastic wrapper shelf rip open drop wrapper run back hall maybe doctor come run hall towards u blood medical thing hand think run u guess decide need calm ran around say yes breathe okay tube clear go back concerned look face say worry okay volunteer place really uncomfortable doctor blood splatter blood face take towel gently wipe recall forehead go work way department try find suppose come across large male black nurse ask could tell admission office area tell go head saw nurse sit desk small newborn maybe preemie next think incubator phone get phone explain woman really fine kept bed could get various department find suppose suppose volunteer nurse nice young black female nurse wait get phone wonder new pediatric unit svh build new pediatric sleep center point nurse say woman could get bed would take care could take bed head empty bed come across male nurse say way put back another empty bed could follow jokingly say oh suppose give ride laugh go really fast keep practically run keep guess staff think play empty bed something look grin saw doctor end hall aim like go run get stop say hello hair completely gray speak briefly friendly expect see year think would seem happy see chalk either busy one mood either way would act take personally,13.561045,13.694703,1660,1,14,3,6,7,7,6,17,10,29,2
1708,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,321,2001-10-31,"I was with my family in St. Joe. I was thinking that it would be fun for us to all go to a professional baseball game together. Not sit all in one row but several rows, one in front of the other, so we can talk together more. The next thing I know we are there. I'm not sure who all was there but it was at least my parents and my siblings and I. I wanted something to eat and drink but no one else was so I wouldn't say anything. I took some money, a ten-dollar bill, out of my wallet, folded it up and put it in my shoe. Someone said something about it. I said I forgot to do it earlier and I don't usually put it in my shoe but that was easiest right now. We were referring to the fact that you are supposed to put money, like a one-dollar bill, on your person all the time for luck. I think I actually got the money out because I was hungry. A bit letter I noticed others eating and drinking and I was aggravated because no one offered to have me go with them or offered to get me anything. Brian F was eating potato wedges and drinking a coke. Later I noticed others had gone and gotten things too. Still later Brian F was now eating a cheeseburger and drinking a coke. BJ asked if I wanted to get some ice cream and I said no, I really didn't want ice cream. What I really wanted was the potato wedges and a sprite. While we were watching the game I was almost hit a couple of times by fly balls. I also noticed that in between the sections of the stands there were these very tall, white, plastic, flexible holders that were taller than the stands and they each held a golf ball at the end. The golf ball could be released and thrown somewhere. It had some purpose for the game. I thought it was very unusual. I was walking around with Brian F and BJ and we were talking about people writing and talking about the end of the war. I was thinking that if I had initiated this conversation a year ago they would have dismissed me and not paid any attention. Now BJ had heard this from someone else and was very intrigued and ready to discuss it. I recognized that things seem to come around to their geographic areas a year or so later than here. Kind of like the time lapse between New York and California fashions hitting other parts of the country. Anyway, we were talking about this one series of books, I believe they were written about The Rapture. Two of the women I worked with last year were really into them but I didn't read them because they didn't sound like they coincided with my beliefs. Anyway, BJ was very intrigued by the whole idea and Brian F was just listening with interest and as though he wanted to learn and understand. typical for Brian F. I remember saying something about this books talking about the world opening up and swallowing people and fires etc. I reminded them that they are still written by men, as was the Bible, and as were Conversations with God, by Neale Donald Walsh. I went on to say that it is impossible for us to know these things for certain. That even though these people claim to be writing from God's inspiration, they are still human men and fallible. I went on to say that we each need to find our own truth. we left the ball game and went to another place. I don't know what the place was. It was a semi-circle theater. The round stage was completely dark except for a spotlight on the man speaking. The back half of the round stage had individual dark curtains. Each curtain had the name of a place in lights. One of them was Lesourdesville Lake Amusement Park. We chose that curtain. Immediately we were transported to another place. I thought it was going to be Lesourdesville Lake but it wasn't. This is difficult to describe. It looked as though we were watching a movie scanning the night skyline of a large city, but at the same time it felt as though we were there. not physically flying and not in an airplane. which is why it is difficult to describe that part. But now it is suddenly daytime and we fly past the World Trade Center towers and they are on fire and smoking. I realize where we are and when and I become very upset and fight back tears. we are on a boat and it begins to burn. It quickly docks and people begin to get off. No one is panicking and I get off safely. There was a coral colored carpet and I had to go up several steps to get off, but it was almost mazelike. I had to go up a step, walk to one side for a little while and find an opening to go up the next step. There was one woman in particular with long sandy-brown hair. I don't know who she is but we said something to each other as we were leaving. we are back in the theater. My family members are all in seats. I am approaching them with a notepad in hand. I see the Homers sitting there as well. Kenny H is sitting on the end of the row. I sit down on the floor next to him to ask him about this experience. I am thinking that I am sure that I am still dreaming. I asked Kenny about his experience. He said they did in fact go where their curtain said they were going. He said they were awake in coming to the theater and they were awake now. I was disappointed to hear that because I was so sure to that point that I was still dreaming. I was writing feverishly to get everything down on a notepad. Some people came up behind us and set up a table and sat down there. They seemed to be upper-class people. My paper was making noise as I turned the pages and they were getting very annoyed. I was having trouble finding a clean sheet of paper but did not want to stop for fear of losing some of this. Matthew came up to me. He is a much younger boy, maybe 9 or 10. I was trying to gather all of my things to go and sit with him. I had lots of papers, a drink, and a winter coat. I was having trouble getting it all. Matthew helped. As we were walking to our seats we passed Darren. He said that Matthew had said he would visit with Darren after this. I was aggravated by this and said I would have talk to Matthew about this and we would see. We went to our seats.",family st joe think would fun u go professional baseball game together sit one row several row one front talk together next thing know sure least parent sibling want something eat drink one else say anything take money ten dollar bill wallet fold put shoe someone say something say forget earlier usually put shoe easy right refer fact suppose put money like one dollar bill person time luck think actually get money hungry bit letter notice others eat drink aggravate one offer go offer get anything brian eat potato wedge drink coke later notice others go gotten thing still later brian eat cheeseburger drink coke bj ask want get ice cream say really want ice cream really want potato wedge sprite watch game almost hit couple time fly ball also notice section stand tall white plastic flexible holder taller stand hold golf ball end golf ball could release throw somewhere purpose game think unusual walking around brian bj talk people write talk end war think initiate conversation year ago would dismiss pay attention bj heard someone else intrigue ready discus recognize thing seem come around geographic area year later kind like time lapse new york california fashion hit part country anyway talk one series book believe write rapture two woman work last year really read sound like coincide belief anyway bj intrigued whole idea brian listen interest though want learn understand typical brian remember say something book talk world open swallow people fire etc remind still write men bible conversation god neale donald walsh go say impossible u know thing certain even though people claim write god inspiration still human men fallible go say need find truth leave ball game go another place know place semi circle theater round stage completely dark except spotlight man speak back half round stage individual dark curtain curtain name place light one lesourdesville lake amusement park choose curtain immediately transport another place think go lesourdesville lake difficult describe look though watching movie scan night skyline large city time felt though physically fly airplane difficult describe part suddenly daytime fly past world trade center tower fire smoke realize become upset fight back tear boat begin burn quickly dock people begin get one panic get safely coral color carpet go several step get almost mazelike go step walk one side little find open go next step one woman particular long sandy brown hair know say something leave back theater family member seat approach notepad hand see homer sit well kenny sit end row sit floor next ask experience thinking sure still dream ask kenny experience say fact go curtain say go say awake come theater awake disappointed hear sure point still dream write feverishly get everything notepad people come behind u set table sat seem upper class people paper make noise turn page get annoy trouble find clean sheet paper want stop fear lose matthew come much young boy maybe try gather thing go sit lot paper drink winter coat trouble get matthew help walk seat pas darren say matthew say would visit darren aggravate say would talk matthew would see go seat,13.820354,13.574141,1199,9,17,2,8,11,5,4,11,18,24,2

We were practically running through a mall because it was almost time for a movie to start. We were going to see K-Pax. He had my hand and was practically pulling me along telling me to hurry. I finally let go of his hand and let him go on ahead. I think we made it in time though I don't remember for sure. I was with Mike M again but this time he looked different. We were at my home but it looked like my birth home. At some point I had woken up, in the dream not from the dream, and realized that he had moved in with me while I was sleeping. He was concerned about me because of my life situation lately and how I have been feeling as a result, particularly that I have been sleeping too much. He came in and sat on the bed by my side and was trying to help me wake up and encouraging me to get out of bed. I got up and headed for the bathroom. He had gone shopping and bought tons of stuff that was sitting everywhere. There was barely a path to walk through the house and patio. There was a lot of frozen food that I wondered why he hadn't put it in a freezer but realized it would never fit in my small freezer. I don't even know what all of the other stuff was. There were some decorative items and some kitchenware. I went outside and many of my relatives on my mother's side of the family were there. I know Larry K, Bruce W, and Sue K were there, they were making comments about Mike M and all of these things that he purchased. BJ came up to me and offered me some yellow gum. It was a small roll and she broke a piece off and gave it to me. She said Mike M had given it to her for her breath.

It wasn't two separate women but two of the same woman. They went and got into their little toy car and were going to leave. Now just one of the wives was in the car. They were having trouble getting out of their garage. I helped them somehow. It was as if I was playing with toys because I bent over and reached down and helped them. Some of the neighbors came out after them. They were angry with them. They drove their car up a set of stairs. They were running back into their apartment to get away from someone. Now real people were inside an apartment. There were two people sitting in old-fashioned bathtubs full of water. One really large man came in. He is one that they had been trying to get away from. He had nothing on but shorts/boxers/swimming trunks. I came up behind him and grabbed his ankles and made him fall head first into one of the tubs.

I said it was so close to dark that I was concerned that we would not be able to find our way in the dark. They finally agreed and we cut straight across the way we had come. We ran into Barb M. We are standing and talking to her only now it seems just me. I asked her if she had ever been on the Main trail and she said no. She is standing with me and looking at a bunch of necklaces. I don't know where they are coming from. I think we are outside. It looks like various. I'm not sure how to describe them. Two of them were very long colored beads. Barb had never been on the Main and didn't even know where it was. I told her I would take her and add a little heart to her day. I did. We got separated. I don't know if she got lost or not. I see her in her car and she is headed back to CI but she is driving on the Main. I waved to her to come back and she does. We tell her that she can't drive on the Main that it is for pedestrians and bicyclists only. I am at Brad S and Amy's house for dinner. We are talking. Amy had invited Darren and Matthew and this other man. This other man wasn't there with his wife. We talked and had a good time. Of course I stayed away from Darren. I went and found Marshall E and I went and found Amy and asked her what was going on. why she had invited Darren. I don't remember her answer. I tried to resolve to be as pleasant as possible. I had talked a little bit to this other man that she had invited. He wanted to know what I was doing. I said basically nothing except being a full-time student because I was too embarrassed to talk about my part-time jobs when I am working on a Ph.D. We sat down to have dinner and this other man is playing with my foot under the table. I got Amy by herself and asked her what was going on. Somehow I knew this man was married but I don't remember now how. She said that yes he is married but that he only sees Shannon on weekends and I don't know how that is going anyway. I said but I don't want to be the reason anyone's marriage breaks up.

1714,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,327,2001-11-24,"I was on my go-cart/bicycle/car. I will call it my car from here because that is what I was calling it in the dream. I was going to St. Joe. I picked up several of my relatives on the Harris side of the family. Allen was one of them but I don't remember who the others were. They got on behind me like they were one behind the other as if on a motorcycle. We were going for a drive but I don't remember where we were headed. I was going up a hill and I was having difficulty getting up the hill. Uncle H used his feet to help us get up this hill. I am sitting in Doctor Da' office. Mother and Daddy were there with me. I had an 8 am appointment. Doctor Da is a dentist. We sat there. We kept waiting and waiting all day long until almost 4 pm. I finally asked while we were still waiting and he said that he didn't show that we had an appointment. I said I had just made the appointment two months ago and that I had made it for first thing in the morning so the rest of the day I could have free. I was upset because I had now lost the whole day. He didn't even apologize. He just said that I didn't have an appointment and it wasn't in his books. He didn't have anything computerized. He just had a paper appointment book. I thought it might be the receptionist fault. that perhaps she didn't write it down in the book when we spoke. He asked me if I had a specific problem and I said that I did. I've had this tooth that I lost a filling and it's been bothering me for a long time. He said I could schedule another appointment. When I scheduled the last time the soonest I could get in was two months later and now I was going to have to wait another two months. I was very upset because Mother and Daddy thought that I had screwed up. They thought that maybe I had written it down wrong. Then there was some discussion about my taking the relatives for a ride in my car and how inappropriate that was. Matthew was with us and so was Bill F. Someone from Doctor Da' office had borrowed some audio books or videos. First it was just one and she brought it out and gave it back to me, but later she came back with 3 or 4 more. I noticed that they were all still in their cellophane wrappers which meant they had not even watched them or listened to them. They were still brand new. I finally decided to go ahead and leave. I had some other things too. Bill F was driving a pick-up truck so I put my things in the back of the truck and told Bill F to go ahead and take Matthew back and I would just go ahead and drive my car back MYSELF.

1715,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,328,2001-11-25,"Shortly after connecting with this man and after a phone conversation with Matthew I said I really needed to get more serious about joining the YMCA, knowing how much better I'll feel after I do. I just got done talking on the phone with Matthew and after I finished talking on the phone with this man I immediately drove to PLU to see Matthew. He was having some problems with his skin. He had this red blotchy. something. all over his skin. He was somewhat successful cooling it with some hand lotion he found at the YMCA. I did kind of the same thing as soon as I heard what they were saying. I went and took a hot shower and felt so much better instead of the lotion. But I noticed in a mirror that it was all red splotches, like hives. We discussed calling an ambulance but for whatever reason we didn't.

1717,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,330,2001-11-25,"I was in the city where I live. I stopped by Petsmart to buy something to send to ground zero for the dogs there. It was $2.33. Petsmart said they collect things that people want to send there and that they send the shipments every few days. I could just pay for it and they would ship it. When she rang up the sale she didn't take my money. She said, no, we'll take care of it. Yet, she had rung it up on the register and she left the register open. I gave it to her and I left. For some reason I went back in and some woman was talking about something that happened to her and she said something about the Grace of God. I said, I think everyone has a little bit of the Grace of God in them. I was talking to her and one other woman then I realized that one of the store managers had overheard me. I went ahead and was pushing a cart for someone reason. I turned the cart around in a very tight space and I had two things in my arms, like a binder and a pair of shoes and something else. Odd for being a pet store. But they were my things. I put the cart back and went outside. It was raining a little bit and I rushed to get in my car. It was dark then. I am trying to get out of this parking lot and it is no longer raining and no longer dark. There are all these chain link fences. high. and they are kind of like a maze and I am having trouble getting out. I don't even remember how I got in through this. There were a couple of places that I thought I could get out but I was afraid to try because it was such a narrow opening. This one place I tried. It was at an angle but I caught the car on a wire or something as I went through and it snapped. I was worried that I had damaged the car. As soon as I went through I realized I couldn't get out from there so I had to go back the way I came. I had to really, really maneuver the car around so I could get it at the right angle so I could get through and I was worried about getting caught on that wire again. I did get through but there were like two or three wires. One was stuck to the front of the car but it kept stretching as I went through and it finally snapped around. Again I was afraid I had damaged the car. Then I realized that someone had parked their car previously and now it was gone so that gave me an opening to get out. So I went out this way. Then the pavement was almost like these really large cement. rough. rocks. It was really rough driving on them. I thought if I damage my car Daddy is going to think I was careless and I will need to reassure him that I have been trying to be very careful. That I've learned to be very careful not to damage my car by being careless. I finally got to a smooth road and I was trying to figure out how to get back home from where I was. I was on W. 56th St. I realized I had to go up this hill and now, instead of my regular car that I have in waking life, I know I was driving a VW bug but it was without the shell and a one-person vehicle. It was almost like, at least partially, it went under my own power. Maybe bicycle pedals. I had to go up this hill. I was having trouble getting up the hill. getting enough speed or power. I was talking to someone else or someone was commenting on it was a VW bug. I don't know. This part is very sketchy and makes absolutely no sense to me. It's like I'm still traveling through the streets. I had to go through part of downtown Indy. At the same time as I am going through downtown, it is as though someone is interviewing this small group of people. Three of them were male dressed in black for lack of a better word I will call them vigilantes but they were men who tried to fight crime in our city. They were talking about what they would have done and how they would have been prepared. I thought they were talking about the 911 attack. They said they would have known ahead of time and they would have been on walkie-talkies and would have cut the kids off at the pass and warned the teacher, etc. I am driving along the street and the one man is talking to a woman, girlfriend maybe, in his group, by cell phone. She is sitting on a step outside the building, saying I told you that you could leave me out of it and you said no you wanted me in it and now you're telling me that you don't need me. She was just a little perturbed. She wasn't really mad at him. Just a little perturbed by it.

1719,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,332,2001-11-27,"Kendall B came to visit but we were once again at my birth home. Mother and Daddy were there. He was very out-going. Shortly after he arrived he took all of his clothes off because he liked to be naked around the house. We were going to sit and talk about my dissertation but we kept getting interrupted. There were a lot of people around and a lot of commotion. I finally asked him if he would mind going downstairs to sit and talk. He said that was fine with him. We went through the kitchen and he opened up some of the kitchen cabinets looking for something sweet to eat. He found a couple of chocolate chip cookies and grabbed those on the way down. We went downstairs and there were people down there too. I think Bev and I'm not sure who else. So we were being distracted there too. I kept having difficulty getting other people to leave us along so we could actually have a discussion. I think I went back upstairs once or twice looking for more of my notes or materials. I did convince him to put some clothes on because it was making my parents uncomfortable. It started out that he just flew in for the day and then he was going to fly back out that night. But with all the people and commotion I was concerned that we weren't going to be finished in time. He said that really wasn't a problem at all. He ended up going to spend the night in a hotel I think. I just had this image of opening this hotel room and it was. you could barely open the door, like something was sitting behind it. So I was trying to open the door far enough to somehow push that out of the way so I could open the door all the way. I also remember those doorways were very low and Kendall B was going to have to bend over to come down this hall and get in the door to his hotel room.

1720,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,333,2001-11-27,"I went back to work as a store manager for SFI but I took over Pam T's store. It was such a mess. You could hardly walk into the backroom. There was merchandise everywhere and all kinds of odd things too, like little Christmas statues/knick knacks and decorations. Plastic containers and lots and lots of clothes. It was a mess!! After the first few days I had a very brief informal store meeting telling the staff what to expect over the next few weeks and over the next year. I told them what I had done at the previous store and what I would be doing and what I expected from them. One or two of the employees arrived late. We had forgotten to lock the door after all the employees got there. We had customers wandering in and we had to get them back we had to apologize. Some of them were a bit upset. We went back to our meeting. I told them I was going to be spending my time initially, getting the backroom in order and that I would expect them to take care of the sales floor. keep it neat and clean and orderly. Take care of the customers. Be very sales oriented, etc. When we left we went out through the back door. It was pitch black dark. You couldn't see anything. They tried to show me where the store key was hidden outside the store. I was comparing this to where we hid the key at the other store. In waking life we didn't do such a thing. I also talked about how dark it was and asked them if they normally bring flashlights. They said no they just deal with it. I made a mental note that I had to talk to Lisa S about that. On another day during business hours I went up to one of the employees and instructed her on recovery. She didn't seem really offended by my instruction. She asked a couple of questions and then got started. I also made a comment to all of the staff that I like to make surprise visits when I am not scheduled to work and that I had better never find a boyfriend or spouse visiting during working hours. There was a boyfriend visiting at that time so I went up to him and told him that he needed to go and the employee said she understood. He kind of wandered around and pretended to be shopping. I noticed this when I was instructing the other employee on how to recover the racks. Lisa S came for a visit. When she did I had the backroom in much better order. She didn't seem that interested. I didn't get the reaction from her that I wanted. She was pleased and certainly noticed the improvements. I said doesn't it look great? And she said yes. I said there is just so much merchandise back here. It was folded up on shelves. It was a long narrow backroom. She said yes but this store had gotten merchandise that a lot of the other stores did not get and that's why all the unusual stuff. We would be selling through most of this stuff over the winter season. We had both been working in the store and were exhausted and we just kind of collapsed for a little bit. There was an area where Lisa S actually laid down. I said, okay Lisa S it's time to exercise now. I turned on some exercise music and I started exercising. She said no way and finally did get up and moving and exercising. I also said something to her about that light and it being so dark outside the door at closing. She said that was up to the landlord. I said something really has to be done because it would be much less expensive for them to do something about it now then to deal with a lawsuit if something happens to an employee because of the lack of light. I was giving some employees something to sign. In the place that I sign I wrote Kroger instead of SFI. One employee was talking about how the recent changes I had implemented in the store were spilling over into the rest of her life and made some very positive changes.",go back work store manager sfi take pam store mess could hardly walk backroom merchandise everywhere kinds odd thing like little christmas statue knick knack decoration plastic container lot lot clothes mess first day brief informal store meeting tell staff expect next week next year tell previous store would expect one two employee arrive late forget lock door employee get customer wander get back apologize bit upset go back meeting tell go spending time initially get backroom order would expect take care sale floor keep neat clean orderly take care customer sale orient etc leave go back door pitch black dark see anything tried show store key hidden outside store compare hid key store wake life thing also talk dark ask normally bring flashlight say deal make mental note talk lisa another day business hour go one employee instruct recovery seem really offend instruction ask couple question get start also make comment staff like make surprise visit schedule work well never find boyfriend spouse visit work hour boyfriend visit time go told need go employee say understood kind wander around pretend shopping notice instruct employee recover rack lisa come visit backroom much good order seem interested get reaction want please certainly noticed improvement say look great say yes say much merchandise back fold shelf long narrow backroom say yes store gotten merchandise lot store get unusual stuff would sell stuff winter season work store exhaust kind collapse little bit area lisa actually lay say okay lisa time exercise turn exercise music start exercise say way finally get move exercise also say something light dark outside door close say landlord say something really would much less expensive something deal lawsuit something happen employee lack light give employee something sign place sign write kroger instead sfi one employee talk recent change implement store spill rest life make positive change,13.726081,13.624749,737,3,8,4,3,9,11,6,10,11,21,2
1721,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,334,2001-11-27,"They started fighting over me. They were in a sailboat race together. It was very exciting for them and they won. Afterwards they were totally exhausted and cold. I was sitting in a chair and holding one on each side of me trying to help them warm up and letting them rest and getting their rest back. I don't know what happened from there. I got up to leave and their father, Eddie Arnold, came out of his bedroom. I saw five other men in there with him. A couple of them saw me and kind of made a pass at me. His first wife had died. The younger sister was feeling very lonely and wanted attention. I soon realized that's what both girls wanted. They just wanted all the attention and they didn't give any attention back. The girls had a younger brother and they wanted me to help them keep him out of the room. There were two doors that he could get into and they were side by side. I was trying to hold both doors closed against his efforts. I was trying to find something within my reach that I could block the door with, like a doorstop. I couldn't find anything. The younger sister, I think her name was Sandy [unknown in waking life], kept handing me things. She didn't understand what I was looking for and kept handing me things that weren't going to work. Then I saw that the older sister had a collection of things on the wall and a couple of them were doorstops. One of them had a teddy bear face with little foam pieces that were the facial features. They were on the part that you would stick under the door. So I took the ears and stuff off so I could put it under the door. I knew I could glue them back on when I was done with it. I put it under the door but then it morphed and was no longer a doorstop so it didn't work. I had torn it apart for nothing. I suggested newspaper but that didn't work because he just pulled it right through the door. I tried various things and I ended up having to just sit there and hold the door closed as the girls had wished. I'm thinking the older girl's name was Sharon. Sharon had morphed and was now very small. Her legs had become the size of a Barbie doll. I treated Sandy like a little sister. She had these things out in the hall that were making a lot of noise. I was concerned about bothering the neighbors and convinced her to bring them in. Actually at this point she morphed into a young child. Then I heard someone else in the hallway that was making just as much if not more noise. I asked her what that was and she told me. I told her that was going to have to come in too. She got very sad so I asked her to explain to me what it was. She had these metal pails with water in them and something attached to them that was making all the noise. She would set the water in the hallway on the heat vents. She said that it helped return more water to the land. I asked her if it would work if we took the noisy part off. I said if we just set the pails on the heat vents the water will still return to the land. So that satisfied her and we did that. I went back out in the hall a couple minutes later and the maintenance man was out there. He was upset because the water was sitting there. I explained to him with her standing there what it was for. He really softened and became kind and said that was fine and we could leave them there. Everyone was happy now and we went back into the apartment. I guess sometime along here I had let the little boy back in and he was in his bedroom. I went in and talked to him a little bit and patched things up and made our relationship okay. I was commenting to Sharon on how nice it was to be sleeping with all these people. She looked at me funny and I laughed and I said I just meant having so many family members and loved ones in the house and around you. I said it's just a really nice feeling. She just smiled at me. Then I heard her dad come in and go in his room. I said that I needed to go talk to him for a couple of minutes. I went into his room and that's when he came on to me. At first I tried to resist and then I gave in a little bit. Then I tried to resist again and back and forth. I could see from the light under the doorway that Sharon was pacing back and forth on the other side of the door. Probably wondering what was going on. He had a tub of water sitting by his bed so I asked him to give me a foot massage and that would be my excuse as to why I was in there so long. He soaked my feet in a tub and rubbed them. He was very attentive. It was very nice. One of the girls opened the door and saw us and got really upset. This is odd as I have it recorded twice. The other part of the recording said I used this excuse with Sharon and she was fine with it. They lived in an apartment building as I did. They lived a couple floors above me I think. I tried to go back to my own apartment but I didn't have my key with me and I couldn't remember my apartment number.",start fight sailboat race together exciting afterwards totally exhaust cold sit chair hold one side try help warm let rest get rest back know happen get leave father eddie arnold come bedroom saw five men couple saw kind make pa first wife die young sister feel lonely want attention soon realize girl want wanted attention give attention back girls young brother want help keep room two door could get side side try hold door close effort try find something within reach could block door like doorstop find anything young sister think name sandy unknown wake life keep hand thing understand look keep hand thing go work saw old sister collection thing wall couple doorstop one teddy bear face little foam piece facial feature part would stick door take ear stuff could put door knew could glue back put door morph long doorstop work torn apart nothing suggest newspaper work pull right door try various thing end sit hold door close girl wish think old girl name sharon sharon morph small leg become size barbie doll treat sandy like little sister thing hall make lot noise concern bother neighbor convince bring actually point morphed young child hear someone else hallway make much noise ask tell tell go come get sad ask explain metal pail water something attach make noise would set water hallway heat vent say help return water land ask would work take noisy part say set pail heat vent water still return land satisfy go back hall couple minute later maintenance man upset water sit explain stand really soften become kind say fine could leave everyone happy go back apartment guess sometime along let little boy back bedroom go talk little bit patched thing make relationship okay comment sharon nice sleep people look funny laugh say meant many family member love one house around say really nice feel smile heard dad come go room say need go talk couple minute go room come first tried resist give little bit tried resist back forth could see light doorway sharon pace back forth side door probably wonder go tub water sit bed ask give foot massage would excuse long soaked foot tub rub attentive nice one girl open door saw u get really upset odd record twice part record say use excuse sharon fine live apartment building live couple floor think try go back apartment key remember apartment number,13.912376,13.709877,1007,7,7,3,5,9,8,5,9,16,18,2
1722,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,335,2001-11-27,"I was moving into Grandma F's old house. I'm not sure why I was moving in there. I don't recall actually moving my things in. I had come down the gravel driveway and I was hearing a lot of noise and thought it was my car. Then I realized that there was a car behind me. It was as though I was spinning in the gravel and couldn't move forward. I finally got it off into the grass and then I realized the noise was coming from the car behind me. They went ahead forward and backed into one of the buildings. There was a man in there working on cars. It was where the chicken house used to be. Maybe it was the chicken house. I thought it was incredible that they were able to get there car backed into the small opening of the building without any problem at all because they didn't seem to have control of the car, the accelerator or the brakes. I don't know if that man ended up being able to help them or not. It seems that he couldn't. They left. It was two black men in a car and I don't know how often St. Joe sees black people. Aunt M came back and showed me the different keys for each of the doors and how to get in. There was a big gap in the doors when you closed them. I was concerned about that for the winter as far as keeping it warm and how much extra it would cost to heat. Especially since I don't like a cold house at all. She talked about what it would take to fix it but she didn't actually say she would get it fixed. I don't know what that was about. Mother was back there. We talked about the people who had lived there before and what had happened to them and them moving out. The brother of one of those women was looking for them and didn't realize they had moved out and was talking about that a little bit. Then I guess he just left. I don't know. Mother and I went into one part of the house. It's not familiar to me. It's around the furnace. We found a bunch of boxes. I looked in one of the boxes and there was a bunch of canning lids and I started to pull those out for mother and then I realized there was other stuff in there. I ended up looking in all the boxes. I found some white and colored gauze. I found a really valuable book on dreams written by Carl Jung and it was in mint condition. I was so excited I was in tears. I was really surprised to find it. that grandma had such a book and that it was in such good condition and that I had found it. For some reason one of the women who used to live there was there now. She had some kind of injury and needed some gauze and first aid tape. I didn't want to give her all the ones that were pretty colors cause I was going to save that and use it as ribbon. I gave her some of the white. As the dream continued she wasn't there anymore. When I took all this stuff in the house and put it away and drug all the empty boxes out into the trash pile, which was in the center of the circular driveway by the barn. I realized I hadn't had lunch and was getting a headache. I found myself a snack bar and ate that. We kept working. That didn't really do the trick so I went down and fixed myself a bowl of soup. We were going through kitchen cabinets. I found some things that the other women had left and was throwing away things that I wouldn't use like baby formula. I sat down and was eating my soup. I'm not sure how to explain this. I felt we were sitting inside yet at the same time it felt like outside as it was a picnic table and there was a lot of greenery and hay and cobwebs at the one end of the table. This stuff was going in my soup. I was picking it out and getting disgusted by it. I started moving all this stuff away from the end of the table. All these family members were now. Bob F and his family were there. BJ, Mike A and family were there. Nicholas F climbed up to the table and grabbed my soup. I said, hey bud how about if I fix you a bowl of your own. He said okay and I started looking for a small bowl for him. While I was doing that Mike A started telling a story. He stopped and somebody said that he didn't think I was listening. I said, I'm listening I'm just looking for a bowl for Nicholas F while I'm listening. I don't know if he ever continued his story or not. I got Nicholas F some soup and then I started going back through the cabinets again. I said, ah here is the important stuff, the pasta! We talked a little bit about my spaghetti container here at home and how I always keep it full and that spaghetti is my primary comfort food. I was telling everyone about the dream book I found and how excited I was about that. Mother and I were outside. I realized that I needed to take a broom and sweep off the outside windows and walls because they were full of cobwebs and dirt and stuff. I went back inside and. this is really strange. It is as though I was sitting inside and mother was sitting outside and I wanted to raise the shades. They were the old-fashioned roll shades. I lifted up the screen and realized I still couldn't' get to it so I asked mother to raise the shade. Then I thought that was really odd and that I would have to go outside every time I wanted to raise or lower a shade. My soup was full of grass, and dirt and cobwebs. I asked mother where the compost pile was. She showed me and I went out and got rid of the rest of my soup. It was vegetable soup. I was pushing all of this greenery stuff away from the table so that wouldn't happen anymore. I told the others that they could come and visit now but that was part of my apprehension about moving in there - that people would be dropping any and all the time. I wasn't sure I was ready for that. It is one of the things I appreciated about living further away.",move grandma old house sure move recall actually move thing come gravel driveway hear lot noise think car realize car behind though spin gravel move forward finally get grass realize noise come car behind go ahead forward back one building man work car chicken house use maybe chicken house think incredible able get car back small opening building without problem seem control car accelerator brake know man end able help seem leave two black men car know often st joe see black people aunt come back show different key door get big gap door close concerned winter far keep warm much extra would cost heat especially since like cold house talk would take fix actually say would get fix know mother back talk people live happen move brother one woman look realize move talk little bit guess leave know mother go one part house familiar around furnace find bunch box look one box bunch lid start pull mother realize stuff end look box find white colored gauze find really valuable book dream write carl jung mint condition excite tear really surprised find grandma book good condition find reason one woman use live kind injury need gauze first aid tape want give one pretty color cause go save use ribbon give white dream continue anymore take stuff house put away drug empty box trash pile center circular driveway barn realize lunch get headache find snack bar ate keep work really trick go fix bowl soup go kitchen cabinet find thing woman leave throw away thing use like baby formula sit eat soup sure explain felt sit inside yet time felt like outside picnic table lot greenery hay cobwebs one end table stuff go soup pick get disgust start move stuff away end table family member bob family bj mike family nicholas climb table grabbed soup say hey bud fix bowl say okay start look small bowl mike start tell story stop somebody say think listen say listen look bowl nicholas listen know ever continue story get nicholas soup start go back cabinet say ah important stuff pasta talk little bit spaghetti container home always keep full spaghetti primary comfort food tell everyone dream book find excited mother outside realize need take broom sweep outside window wall full cobweb dirt stuff go back inside really strange though sit inside mother sit outside want raise shade old fashion roll shade lift screen realize still get ask mother raise shade think really odd would go outside every time want raise low shade soup full grass dirt cobweb ask mother compost pile show go get rid rest soup vegetable soup push greenery stuff away table happen anymore tell others could come visit part apprehension move people would drop time sure ready one thing appreciate live away,13.911174,13.6236725,1172,3,14,4,6,14,7,7,20,16,35,2
1723,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,336,2001-11-29,"We went to visit a friend or someone I know that lives in the country. He has 22 acres of land and he was going to be on the news with his tractor and with a cow or a dog. He does these tricks with this animal and his tractor. I can't really explain what the tricks were even though I can visualize one of them a bit. There was some comment about how good the food was there and about it being out in the country and being an hour away from something but I don't know what. I was asleep in one of the bedrooms and someone came in and crawled in bed with me and I couldn't wake up. I thought that it was really happening and I couldn't wake up and I was feeling for the person. I thought maybe it was Nick R. I kept saying, Nick R, is that you? But he wouldn't answer. Finally, the dog went in and started attacking this person and chased him away. It turns out it wasn't Nick R. The dog was kind of shaking me. I was finally able to wake up then. There was something else about this dog but I can't remember what now. I closed the bedroom door then and stuck something under the door. The dog grabbed it and drug it outside and was attacking it. It was just sitting there tapping his paw against the floor and guarding this thing. I guess because it still had the scent of this man. I finally got up and went out and said good dog and then said something else to him so he knew he didn't have to stand guard anymore. It was a collie. There was another little dog, like the one on the Taco Bell commercials, came in too and I picked him up and took him inside and let him run up the steps.",go visit friend someone know live country acre land go news tractor cow dog trick animal tractor really explain trick even though visualize one bit comment good food country hour away something know asleep one bedroom someone come crawl bed wake think really happen wake feel person think maybe nick keep say nick answer finally dog go started attack person chase away turn nick dog kind shake finally able wake something else dog remember closed bedroom door stick something door dog grab drug outside attack sit tap paw floor guard thing guess still scent man finally get go say good dog say something else know stand guard anymore collie another little dog like one taco bell commercial come pick take inside let run step,13.593285,13.656858,331,2,4,3,4,6,2,5,8,3,10,2

I guess it was Bill F, Matthew, and me. Doctor Pa and Doctor Pi were both there too. They had some kind of stockings over their faces, making their faces look very strange, like a bank robber might do. They had them over their faces for the surgery, which they were discussing. Doctor Pa planned for the surgery and some options. I wanted to be sure what they were talking about. I said I would like to get it all done today and someone said, ok. Well, then that's what we'll do. I still didn't know what that meant. The five of us were going to drive to the hospital together. At first I asked if I was to ride in the ambulance with Matthew or drive separately. I think they said we could all just drive.

1725,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,338,2001-12-04,"Before I arrived or before I got into the house I was talking on the phone or something about having had some surgery. So I was arriving in pajamas and a robe and I was talking about a itch and about how each time I scratched the itch my gown moved up a little bit and I was making jokes about that. So I was still joking about that when I entered the home to begin the lecture. I was using a hairbrush to scratch my itch. I was sharing my life story of my journey to finding my current path. It was an in-home lecture. Some of it was my family and some were, I suppose, friends of family. I remember specifically Mother, Daddy, Bev, Aunt P, Larry K, Bruce W, Dick W, Sue K, Linda W. At one point, when I was kind of caught off guard, I had forgotten that this was the purpose of this lecture so I was having a little bit of trouble composing myself to start to talk. I found myself very teary and didn't want this to be a tearful talk. I was also somewhat concerned because my parents were there and I was guarded on what I wanted to share in front of them and I also did not want to hurt them in anyway by anything I said. I finally got started and a couple of times people started their own conversations about unrelated things. I just quit talking until they all quit talking and decided to pay attention. I was thinking how rude that was and how much it irritates me. I find it disrespectful to a speaker. I went through a little bit of my history and I got to People's drug stores and I started that maybe I needed to fast forward through. just recap company closings, etc and how I took that as a sign to change career paths.",arrive get house talk phone something surgery arrive pajama robe talk itch time scratch itch gown move little bit make joke still joke enter home begin lecture use hairbrush scratch itch share life story journey find current path home lecture family suppose friend family remember specifically mother daddy bev aunt larry bruce dick sue linda one point kind catch guard forget purpose lecture little bit trouble compose start talk find teary want tearful talk also somewhat concerned parent guard want share front also want hurt anyway anything say finally get start couple time people start conversation unrelated thing quit talk quit talk decide pay attention think rude much irritates find disrespectful speaker go little bit history get people drug store start maybe need fast forward recap company close etc take sign change career path,13.841895,13.918913,326,3,8,3,9,7,8,1,9,6,14,2
1726,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,339,2001-12-05,I was working for BCC. Our desks were right next to each other as they were in waking life when I worked there. The daughter of the boss was working right next to me. She was younger and turned the radio up really loud. I don't remember what kind of music it was or if that bothered me also or if it was just the volume. I asked her to turn it down and she refused. I reached over and turned it down myself and told her it was difficult to hear on the phone with the music so loud. She just reached out and turned it back up. I reached down and turned it down again. She turned it back up. The boss came up and told me to just let it go so I quit. I was just working there part-time. I remember I was packing up all of my personal things in plastic grocery bags and I was surprised at how much I had. I had two of them full of nothing but candles. all different colors and sizes. The boss had left. It wasn't that I was present but I knew that he was talking to someone about my leaving and concerned about it. He didn't want me to leave. He finally came back and was negotiating with me to stay. My negotiations included a $2 an hour increase in pay and 3 weeks paid vacation and I don't remember what else.,work bcc desk right next wake life work daughter bos work right next young turn radio really loud remember kind music bother also volume ask turn refuse reach turn tell difficult hear phone music loud reach turn back reach turn turn back bos come tell let go quit work part time remember pack personal thing plastic grocery bag surprise much two full nothing candle different color size bos leave present know talk someone leave concern want leave finally come back negotiate stay negotiation include hour increase pay week pay vacation remember else,13.606732,13.87002,251,0,5,1,2,7,4,4,5,3,13,2
1727,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,340,2001-12-08,"Matthew and I were on our way to St. Joe and we stopped on the rode and picked up Bob A. He was back in my home state to visit his family. He is a career army officer and lives in Texas I believe. We stopped and picked him up and agreed to take him home before we went to see my parents. He and I were both giving Matthew directions while he and I both chatted. his parents did not live where they do/did in waking life. He directed Matthew to some back roads. I told him I didn't remember his parents living back there or moving back there. We got to his house and four of his brothers came out. In waking life they were not his brothers but Don Sc and three of his brothers. I commented to Bob A that he and his brothers haven't changed a bit in 25 years, that they all looked exactly like they did when I graduated from high school. I was looking at their height and such. I was amazed that they still looked the same. They hadn't seemed to age at all, height, weight, etc. After we got there we find out that Daddy had wanted to borrow their tractor. I think Bill F was there already but I don't know if he had a car back there or if someone took him there and was waiting for us to take the tractor back to the house. We ended up with three vehicles though. We had my car, a truck, and the tractor. Matthew drove the truck. I drove the car. Bill F drove the tractor. The Sc boys came out to do something to the truck or the tractor. We're getting ready to take the vehicles and tractor back to daddy but now it is Uncle H and Aunt R's house. We're in their garage and there is stuff piled everywhere, wall-to-wall and 5 or 6 feet high. Uncle H is cleaning things out and getting ready to get rid of a lot of stuff. Aunt R is in very good health. Her and I were talking about doing this cleaning. I said, yes, in the last few weeks I've been cleaning a lot of closets and drawers in my own home. It feels so good having done that. Getting rid of stuff that I never use or look at. that just sits there. We were looking for some paper towels because there was oil all over the seat of the tractor. Uncle H and Aunt R were being very frugal. They had the select-a-size paper towels and they would give us the smallest possible each time and it wasn't enough to wipe up the oil. I had a sense at one point when I grabbed two additional ones that they were making some kind of comment about how many of these towels we were using. One of us had done something to spill some water on a worktable or something and we used paper towels to clean it up. We tried to clean it up before they noticed but Uncle H saw us. He said not to worry about it, that he does it all the time. He helped us clean it up. I also get the sense that maybe we were putting a lot of this stuff they were getting rid of in this truck that Matthew was going to drive. I took some little stuffed animals or animal toys of some kind, like you would get in a kids meal - and moving them from one spot to another. By the time we got ready to leave the garage had much less stuff in it. Aunt P was there as well. I just saw her once when we were getting ready to leave. I approached her and thanked her for the money she recently sent me and told her how much I appreciated it. She just asked me again to keep it a secret between us.

1728,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,341,2001-12-08,"Someone had broken into my house. I was wondering if I was dreaming or awake. I thought that I usually only have these dreams when I don't set my house alarm before going to bed and I know I set it last night. But then if I'm dreaming I want to wake myself up and I couldn't. So I was frustrated with myself. I also thought if I'm dreaming and lucid why can't I change what is happening. I could see my front door from my bedroom door, which I can't in waking life. This did not occur to me. I was trying to close and lock my bedroom door very quietly. I was peering out and could see that my front door was partially open. I didn't know if someone had come in and left or if someone was still in the house. I didn't know if it was just maintenance men or someone who had broken in. I went ahead and locked it and hoped that they either wouldn't come upstairs and try to get in or that if they saw that door that maybe they would just leave but they didn't. my bedroom door was right across from the end of my bed. I heard them come up and try the door so I leveraged myself against the door with my feet against the bed hoping to keep them from getting in. I heard them take out the tools and remove the pins in the door. They shouldn't be able to do this from the outside in waking life because the pins are on the inside of the room. But they did remove them. I was being unsuccessful in keeping them out. I tried to reach the alarm pull cord but couldn't get to it. They finally got in and they said something about me not being able to get to it. They didn't hurt me. I started talking to them and trying to be very cooperative so they wouldn't get violent or hurt me. There were both men and women. They said that they had recently bought or built a new home and they were here to get things that they needed or could use in their new house. I said I was surprised that they wanted anything that I have. I went downstairs with them and they had a very large pile of my things that they were going to take with them. One of things that they had was my black everyday dishes. I asked them to let me keep those and I would give them my expensive china that I never use. I told them that it was Noritake, very elegant, and there were many more place settings, etc. so they agreed to that. I was going through these wood cabinets, kind of like an armoire, though they were built into the wall. They had many different size compartments. Some were drawers. Some had doors. Some were just open. I thought this must be a dream because I don't have these cabinets in waking life. I was looking for the china and couldn't find it. I told them the one box was an old whiskey box that would be used to ship 12 bottles. I was getting very nervous because I was afraid they would think that I was lying and didn't really have the china. I suggested that they might have found it already and not realized it. I turned around and saw it sitting in their pile and pointed it out. I told them the other box was the original box and said china on the sides of it. We found it too then.",someone broken house wonder dream awake think usually dream set house alarm go bed know set last night dream want wake frustrate also think dream lucid change happen could see front door bedroom door wake life occur try close lock bedroom door quietly peer could see front door partially open know someone come leave someone still house know maintenance men someone break go ahead lock hop either come upstairs try get saw door maybe would leave bedroom door right across end bed hear come try door leveraged door foot bed hop keep get heard take tool remove pin door able outside wake life pin inside room remove unsuccessful keep tried reach alarm pull cord get finally get say something able get hurt start talk try cooperative get violent hurt men woman say recently buy built new home get thing need could use new house say surprise want anything go downstairs large pile thing go take one thing black everyday dish ask let keep would give expensive china never use told noritake elegant many place set etc agree go wood cabinet kind like armoire though build wall many different size compartment drawer door open think must dream cabinet wake life look china find told one box old whiskey box would use ship bottle get nervous afraid would think lie really china suggest might find already realize turn around saw sit pile point tell box original box say china side find,13.584928,13.630174,630,6,4,3,8,4,6,5,6,12,8,2

1730,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,343,2001-12-09,"I was on this, I don't know what, and Nick R came back. He told me that he never takes me with him because I wouldn't fit in with his rich and famous friends. He told me I wasn't good enough to be with his wealthy friends. He was drinking while I was in the car with him. The roads were yet and he was driving very fast. I was very frightened. It was after that, that he said those things to me. I went ahead and got dressed and was going to meet one of his friends that he told me I wasn't good enough to meet. I was dressed very nicely. There is so much to this and I don't know what order it goes in. I was with someone but I don't know whom. I don't know if I was married to him. We had gone on a trip and I had bought a lot of Native American items, jewelry, feathers, blankets, etc. It was really fabulous. Our butler wasn't around to help us pack and we were in a hurry and we had a baby and we were trying to grab a few things because we had to meet this duchess/important woman. We just had so many beautiful things. Some of them were very small. I was pulling them off and putting them in drawers and stuff so they would be safe to travel and so we wouldn't lose anything. We just left everything else for our butler, hoping that he would get back and be able to get it all packed up for us in time to catch our train. We went in this special place to meet this woman. She was lying on a bed. I curtsied and shook her hand, as did our nanny/assistant to me. We chatted with her briefly. I had to do different things to make sure I was sitting in the right place and sitting properly, etc. The woman is in a hot tub with her husband and making love to him. We were all trying to avert our eyes. My husband had also been sitting on a bed and he fell asleep. I got up and walked away and I was trying to figure out what to do or where to go. I ended up in a hot tub with someone but I have no idea who it was. It wasn't my husband but a man who truly appreciated me. After Nick R told me I wasn't good enough, I got dressed up and I was going to go meet some woman by myself-one of his wealthy friends. I knew my way out. I thought Oh yes, I know my way out because I dreamt this. I dreamt it earlier in the same dream. I went to this woman and her name was Betty [unknown in waking life]. She was very classy. She welcomed me and she could tell I was upset and she asked me why. I told her and she was very sympathetic. She asked me if I would like some strawberries and cream. I was looking at my assistant and this woman to take the lead on what to do and how to act. I got a very small bowl of strawberries and cream. I didn't go sit with them but rather stood back in a dark spot where I wouldn't be seen in case I did something wrong or spilled something, etc. One of her female staff members came to me and asked me if I would like to go sit down and I said, very truthfully I would really like a place where I can sit and be alone. She took me to this place where I could sit by myself. It was like a bench in a closet. As I was sitting there eating, the bowl was suddenly much larger and fuller than when I started. I was fighting back the tears. I hadn't eaten all day so I was very hungry and very tired. But then someone came in and told me that they had to hide me. So I put my feet up on this bench and they pulled the clothes past me. These two young men came in. It was their closet and they were looking for some clothes. The mother and the staff person were trying to distract them and try to hurriedly select something so they wouldn't discover me but they did. They were so kind and compassionate. They wanted to know what happened and I told them. They told me that he didn't deserve to be with someone like me. They said I have so much love to give and just want to care for someone and be attentive to them. I wanted to go sit with Aunt J and ask her to tell me all about Uncle A. For some reason, at some point I sensed that he was the one I was with. He was protecting me as a spirit protector. There was also something about one or more housing subdivisions.

1731,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,344,2001-12-09,"I was with my CIIS classmates and we were at some kind of army facility. We were working on a project to reduce violence or develop methods other than weapons to defeat the enemy. We were having different meetings. At times I was frustrated because, as usual, people weren't hearing me or weren't truly considering what I was saying. We had found some toy green plastic army men. We had decided to make something like a biscuit and place the toys inside the biscuit. The others wanted to put them in before baking the biscuit. I told them they would melt that way and that we would have to put it in later. They all disagreed with me and they were going to go ahead and do it their way. Really strange. I don't know how that ended up but I think I saved one out to maybe do myself, my way. I moved on to the kitchen area where the men on KP duty were preparing meals. I learned that a lot of our men got sick from that food. One of the reasons was that they got salmonella poisoning from hamburgers that had been cooked but then had been left sit out too long. The cooks would not know how many to prepare at a time and they didn't want to run out so they would prepare more than they thought they needed. They didn't want to throw any away so they would leave them sit out until the next group of men came in to eat. I had suggested that they have a counter at the doorway. a bar like you see at an entertainment venue. so it would count the number of men coming in. The men in the kitchen would be able to see/watch it and could use that as a gauge to determine how many to prepare. The head cook thought that was a great idea and said he would take it to the proper decision-maker. I pursued that a little bit and told him I was going to follow up with him and see how that conversation went and so forth. I met someone and I introduced myself as the future VP of the US. He kind of chuckled. I chuckled too but said, you just watch. A little bit later I met Hillary Clinton. She was the President of the US. I again introduced myself as the future VP of the US. We chatted a bit and I said, I'll be following up on that counter idea. She looked at me quizzically as she didn't know what I was talking about. Someone else was in our conversation and said, we'll talk about that later. I went back to the kitchen and I was still looking at things there. It occurred to me, I suggested to someone, if we would be able to poison the enemy's food as an alternative to weaponry. They said yes that would probably be doable. might be fairly easy. There was a discussion about what kind of foods we would use and such. I overheard one of the men talking about getting a divorce when he gets home. I was talking to them about that and discouraging the idea. He said something to me that hurt my feelings. I said so and was being a little dramatic about it but not letting on that I was. He apologized and I said, we'll make that. I had been standing on the other side of the counter so I went around the corner and gave him a hug but he didn't let go. He was kind of joking around and kind of doing that for the benefit of his buddies there because they were getting a real chuckle watching us. Then he kissed me. A long time. Then he asked me how I learned to kiss like that. Then he whispered in my ear, you want to give them a real show now? We'll give them a little tongue. I said, You want to give them a real show?

I don't know if I forgot about them or what but I came back to the kitchen and the two trays in the oven were very done.

I realized that they were left there from our cookie baking day in December. There were snickerdoodles, chocolate chip cookies and something else. I had newspaper spread out on the kitchen counters and was spreading out these cookies. I ate one or two of them. Some other people coming through the kitchen would grab one and eat them.

The first one I decided on we had moved all my things into. Then I decided that the other one faced the screened-in porch and ocean so I decided to make that my office instead. That way I could work in there and listen to and feel the ocean. Then there were two other rooms. One for storage and another for a laundry room. It wasn't a fancy place. I was just absolutely in love with it because it was on the ocean and because of the screened-in porch. I kept saying how great it was to be on the ocean and that it was even less expensive than where we were living now. Bev and her family were there helping us move. As we were moving I was asking different people if they had been out to the beach yet. Bev had because she loves the ocean as much as I do and she just thought it was so great. I said, good, now you'll come to visit me more. She said, Absolutely. Especially in the summer. I asked her if she had taken Rachel S out to the beach yet and she said she had and that Rachel S had loved it. Stephen F was there and Mari Kate S. They were being especially helpful.

1742,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,355,2001-12-25,"I was at my birth home with all of my siblings. I was trying to talk Bill F and Brian F into switching bedrooms with Bev and me. One of them didn't want to do it but I don't remember why. I was trying to get them to switch, first of all, because Daddy had put a sliding glass door to the patio in their room. I had Sir Gallahad and I had decided to keep him because Bill F was going to be his primary caretaker. If I had the room with the sliding glass door I could put him out on the patio at night and he would be easier to clean up after. Bev didn't want to switch rooms and Bill F didn't want to switch. We talked a little bit about Brian F and Bev sharing a room and Bill F and I sharing a room. But then we decided that was not the best idea at our age. We finally ended up switching bathrooms. We ended up doing a major remodel to the bathroom that was going to belong to Bev and me. When we got done with the remodel it had a kind of Florida feel to it. It was a lot of white wicker. Very spacious. Mother said after we were done that she was really glad we had remodeled because she liked it so much more. We moved the bathtub. We took the shower stall out. It was very nice. We had fixed up a whole closet for Sir Gallahad and for another animal. a duck. Sir Gallahad learned how to talk. I don't remember what he said. The sliding glass doors from the boys room seemed to be at the back of the closet. I had to move all of these clothes out of the way every time I wanted to open or close it. I don't think we were going to put Sir Gallahad out there after all. Bill F and someone else had been working with him and gotten him to a point where the hall closet worked very well for him. I remember what we did but not well enough to describe it. Part of the trick was getting him to stay in there at bedtime. It seems that someone else was involved somehow. But I can't remember who or why. Even though Bev and I were living there and sharing a room, Mari Kate S and Andrew S were also there. After we had finished all of the remodeling we were having problems with the toilet in the boys room. It almost overflowed every time you flushed it. Every time we tried to flush it Daddy would have to run in and stop it before it did overflow. I kept having to go to the bathroom so I kept going to use the one we just finished remodeling. But then the last time we used it we had the same problem there. It did overflow a little before Daddy got in there. Earlier, before we did all this moving around or something in Bev and my room, the housekeeper came in and vacuumed the floor. There were some bugs and stuff. I said, well, that's not my fault. She said, no it isn't. There was all this powder and I said, honestly, all the powder is my fault. We wanted to finish cleaning up from our work in the bathrooms. It was getting late and Bev wanted to get Mari Kate S and Andrew S home. We made Andrew S lie down in the boy's room but that wasn't working because he kept getting up. Then I took him into Mother and Daddy's room and turned out all the lights. There were two toilets in there. One sitting out in the room where their white chair always used to sit and the other was in the closet. Andrew S wanted some milk. I went to the refrigerator. There was a baby bottle in there, partially full. Bev told me to just fill that up and give it to him. I didn't even question the fact that I was giving him a baby bottle. I was just questioning filling that one up and giving that one to him. Somebody said that Mother had plenty of milk so it wasn't a problem. So I went ahead and did that. I took him into Mother and Daddy's room and turned out all the lights. Later he got back up again anyway. I had gone into the bathroom and started cleaning up while everyone else was doing something else. I had gotten most of the mess cleaned up except for scrubbing the floor. When I did that Andrew S was sleeping in there. I asked Bev if I could scrub that while Andrew S was sleeping and she told me no. I took him to Mother and Daddy's room to sleep. I did end up scrubbing the bathroom. Nick R was there waiting for us to get done. He finally said he had to go. It was pretty late at night and I was concerned about him driving home and staying awake. He apologized and said that he was sorry but he really had to go because he had an early morning. Andrew S kept interrupting us. Bev was trying to stop him. I was trying to say good-bye. I walked out into the kitchen and was sitting in the corner of the counter. He moved close to me, in between my legs and said he really wanted another chance. I questioned that it would make any difference. He said that it might not make any difference on the phone calls but it would make a difference in any other way. I was really debating and asked him why it wouldn't make any difference on the phone calls but I woke up before he answered.",birth home sibling try talk bill brian switch bedroom bev one want remember try get switch first daddy put slide glass door patio room sir gallahad decide keep bill go primary caretaker room slide glass door could put patio night would easier clean bev want switch room bill want switch talk little bit brian bev share room bill share room decide best idea age finally end switch bathroom end major remodel bathroom go belong bev get remodel kind florida feel lot white wicker spacious mother say really glad remodel like much move bathtub take shower stall nice fix whole closet sir gallahad another animal duck sir gallahad learn talk remember say slide glass door boys room seem back closet move clothes way every time want open close think go put sir gallahad bill someone else work get point hall closet work well remember well enough describe part trick get stay bedtime seem someone else involve somehow remember even though bev live share room mari kate andrew also finish remodel problem toilet boys room almost overflow every time flush every time try flush daddy would run stop overflow keep go bathroom keep go use one finish remodel last time use problem overflow little daddy get earlier move around something bev room housekeeper come vacuum floor bug stuff say well fault say powder say honestly powder fault want finish cleaning work bathroom get late bev want get mari kate andrew home make andrew lie boy room work keep get take mother daddy room turn light two toilet one sit room white chair always use sit closet andrew want milk go refrigerator baby bottle partially full bev tell fill give even question fact give baby bottle question fill one give one somebody say mother plenty milk problem go ahead take mother daddy room turn light later get back anyway go bathroom start clean everyone else something else gotten mess clean except scrub floor andrew sleep ask bev could scrub andrew sleep tell take mother daddy room sleep end scrub bathroom nick wait u get finally say go pretty late night concern drive home stay awake apologize say sorry really go early morning andrew keep interrupt u bev try stop try say good bye walk kitchen sit corner counter move close leg say really want another chance question would make difference say might make difference phone call would make difference way really debate ask make difference phone call wake answer,13.831353,13.635283,1002,1,10,6,3,10,6,4,14,11,24,2

1744,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,357,2002-01-07,"I was in a hotel. I was trying to get out and I was flying. Somehow when I was flying to get out I kept getting to one point where I would get turned around and right back to where I was. I no longer had control and something turned me around and sent me back. There were Christmas trees in this hotel with the old-fashioned tinsel. I thought the trees were so pretty. I ended up in this bar. Maybe there were strippers in there. I was lying on the bar and there was a man there who was my bodyguard. I just thought, I don't want to do this anymore. I just want to get out of here. He came with me. He was going to get me out of there. We were trying to leave the hotel, only now there was another couple with us. It was a black couple. As we were trying to leave the hotel, we kept coming to these things that you might see in an amusement park fun house. It looked like; I don't know how to describe it, like one looked like it was a spiral. It just looked like a picture but you could actually walk into it. You didn't know. You had to just walk into this picture and you didn't know what was going to happen. We did that. Then we came to another place that looked like squares that just kept getting smaller. I actually led us into that one. I had some kind of square thing that one was red. The spiral thing was kind of like silver and black. I had this red square. We were going through. It got to a point where it was so small. I realized that we weren't going to be able to go any further. I said, back up. Back up. For some reason I thought we had to do it quickly. This man I was with, my bodyguard. It was he and I and two other women. He got us out of the hotel and we were in a car. He was driving really fast. He headed into the woods on this road. The road was extremely hilly and curvy. I was very scared because you couldn't see what was in front of you. He was totally confident. Some of those hills were so steep down and so steep back up again. The kind that makes your stomach jump. He is going through the woods. All of the sudden we were in water. Our car was floating in the water. I said, roll down the windows and try to grab some bottles or pieces of wood or something that you can use as a paddle. None of the other three would grab anything. I grabbed a bottle and began paddling. I got us very quickly to a dock. It was out in the middle of the water but it was a dock attached to a house. They couldn't believe how quickly I got us there. I didn't tell them but there was an animal underwater that actually pulled us to the dock. It just seemed that I did it. It was a cow, because later it was a cow's head. We got out of the car and these people invited us in. It turned out to be the family of one of the girls that was with us. I think one of the girls with us was named Phoebe and I think it was her family. They loaned us a boat. We were standing on the dock before then. I was talking to Phoebe and said, You know. This is probably the highlight of our life. This trip that we've been on and where we're going. I don't remember where we were going. She agreed. I said, We really need to just enjoy and appreciate this trip while we're on it. Because we will likely never do anything like this again in our lives. Somewhere along here, before Phoebe joined us, myself and this man were in love. This other woman. I think her name was Patty [unknown] but I don't know here. The three of us decided that we would live together. We decided that we would tell people that we knew. When we were driving, we were driving along this field and saw a friend of ours working in this field. We stopped and were talking to him, I think the man I was in love with was named Tom [unknown in waking life]. Tom told this man, Yep, Patty and I are going to live together. He didn't say anything about me. I was really upset and hurt. I didn't say anything. Then I saw a penny along the road and picked it up. Patty and Tom got in the car. I saw a whole bunch of change along the road and I started picking it up. They were getting really aggravated with me. They kept saying, come on. We've got to go. We've got to go. I was picking up all of this change and putting it in my pocket. When I finally got in the car they said, don't you realize what you were doing was illegal? Picking up that money. I didn't understand what they were talking about. why they thought picking up this money that someone had dropped along the road was illegal. They apparently thought it belonged to this man that we stopped and talked to. We were in the car and Tom and Patty both knew I was really upset because of what Tom had said to our friend and that he didn't mention me. Tom took his pants off like he wanted to have sex with me, as though that would make everything better. I wouldn't have any part of that. We were headed into the road. This is when Phoebe was with us now too. Phoebe's parents loaned us this boat. We were in the boat headed someplace. Phoebe was talking about being pregnant. I said, that's alright Phoebe. You and I can get an apartment and I can help you take care of your baby. Everything will be fine. We learned that Patty was pregnant too but it wasn't Tom's baby. I went back to Phoebe's parent's house. The others were attacked by some men on another boat. I hid under the house when they came there. They left. Tom came back and told me that he realized that I was the only one he really loved.

1746,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,359,2002-01-14,"I was doing a group meeting or lecture in the living room of my birth home. Most of the people in the group were black. I was talking about the power of the subconscious mind and I gave a couple of examples from my own experience. I was really strongly emphasizing that the foundation of it all has to be unconditional faith- that whatever you are wishing for, whatever you are hoping for, whatever you are trying to manifest has to have a strong foundation of faith that it will happen. And I actually used the words you have to have the faith that God loves me, God wants the very best for me, he wants me to be happy, and he will bring this to me. As I was talking, this one lady kept talking to someone else. I asked her a couple of times to please wait until I finished. She would go on. I would ask her again and finally she did stop.

Then later we had her hiding at Jean H and Carl H's house. After the funeral was over I went back there to see her and we realized that the people who tried to kill her the first time were out there somewhere so we crouched way down in a field. They came through and they were poking through the weeds with a stick and they just barely missed the top of our heads. It was a good thing that we were crouched down far enough. Fortunately they couldn't see us. And most people still believed that she had died. There were three men involved. The one man, the one who was the head of the ring, the worst character of the three, actually ended up dying. The other two ended up being hurt or injured or something because they ended up in the hospital. The one died and the other two recovered and did a complete turn around in their lives.

He was going to try to start working on it. I said, no, I will find someone in the city where I live to finish it. I don't remember what else happened with that.

There was like an old shed on the property that we were moving from so we were just going to move in there. We went to one side of this shed and someone was living in there. It turned out that it was somebody who had just moved their things in there without permission. When we told her that we had to move in there she left. Then we went to the other side and saw that there was room there also. It sounds like a duplex but the doors were on opposing walls. That side was full of junk. There was some kind of concern about maybe something we needed not being there. I'm not sure. Maybe there was no bathroom in it or no kitchen maybe. I just don't know.

1753,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,366,2002-01-31,"I was on the television program Just Shoot Me. It was apparently my first time on the show. I was standing waiting, ready for my cue to go on. I was to go into Jack P's office through a side door with a cigar box. There were two short cigars in the box but they actually looked like two rosebuds lying on a white cloth. Before my cue he came out and I was standing next to a crewmember. He said to the crew don't have them offer me or ask me to smoke one of the cigars because I don't want to do that. She nodded yes and he walked away. I thought hmmm, when I go on I'm going to ask him to smoke one of the cigars with me. It was my cue and I went on and he was standing on the right end of his desk and I walked around him to the left end and I opened the cigar box and said here, join me. It kind of threw him for a loop. He acted like he couldn't see or something so I moved around the front of the desk closer to him and again offered him the cigar. Then someone else came in and took them and said something and left. We touched and he was saying something to one of the crew about my doing that and so I decided that I needed to go apologize. We were done for the day and he was in his dressing room, I suppose. I went back and excused myself and said, I really wanted to apologize. He kind of looked at me. I said, Well, I was standing right next to the crew person when you said you didn't want me to do that. It bothered me that you just didn't say it to me since I was standing right there. He smiled. I said, but still, that's no excuse and I am sorry that I did that. He seemed to like that. He smiled and said No problem. Don't worry about it. He left. It was a really weird set. When I was going in and out I was climbing over these boxes and up over these walls and back down. One time when I came in there were all of these boxes piled up, some above my head, with stuff like different bright colored paper towels, different colors of toilet paper and all kinds of stuff. In one box there were marshmallows, both big and small. One of the bags of the large ones was open so I took a couple of them and ate them. One other time Jack P was looking for the marshmallows. He had expressed a romantic interest in me. I think it was to someone else first and then I heard about it.

1754,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,367,2002-02-02,"I stopped to see Dorothy S. What a mistake! She was at home baking cookies for the church or school. There were cookies everywhere. Valentine's day cookies. I stopped in and she greeted me, but not with a hug or anything like she would have in waking life. She opened the door and let me in. I went in and tried to have a conversation and I misworded something and she was asking me what was going on so I told her. She said she wasn't going to go back to school. She was very content being a full time mom and homemaker. I thought that was great. Unfortunately, then I worded the next thing wrong, I said if I could stay home and live off someone else I would do it in a heartbeat. That was not the best way to word it. I went on to say, but I would want to continue my dreamwork because I get such a high off it. It is just so much fun and so rewarding. She just looked at me and didn't smile or respond or anything. I tried to repair my first sentence by saying I think it would be great to be at home full-time to take care of the house and things like that. Her youngest daughter, Tina S, came out. Then they had to go to the school to pick up Tara S. She asked me if I wanted to go along so I did. We got to this school and there was a basket with a bunny in it. I get a sense that it was Tina S's. Dorothy S asked me if I still had my rabbit. I said, No, as he got older and developed his adult coat I became more and more allergic to him. She said, Oh, that was just his first coat. If you had waited until his second you would have been fine. I was thinking, that was his second coat. I didn't say anymore. The rabbit in the basket got away and we were chasing it and he hopped up a tree and was hopping around on the branches. We were having trouble catching him. Finally he started back down and I was able to grab him. I held on to him until- Dorothy S went into the school to get Tara S. When they came out they had this stuff in her hands including this really big stuffed pink animal. When we drove to school I was sitting in the front seat with Dorothy S and Tina S was in back. I don't _____ getting in the car. We went back to. On the way back to her house she was talking about exercising and how she has this stationary bicycle that is so easy to do an hour a day on. She has been doing that and how good she feels. While I was watching her walk into the school to get Tara S it looked to me like she was pregnant. I wasn't going to ask if she wasn't going to say anything because I would hate to be wrong. Because that would imply that she looks like she is pregnant, which she does to me. Anyway, she was talking about what great shape she is in from riding this bike, and going on and on. Then I find out right before I leave that her and Tony S both used the Hollywood 48 diet. After we got home these three men showed up and she was playing racquetball in the house with these three men, in the dining room and family room area. She wasn't really talking much so I finally picked up my keys and said, Well, I'm sorry but I need to go Dorothy S. I tried to wait until they took a little break so I could hug her and she just kind of looked at me and kept playing. So I just waved goodbye and headed out the door and left. I tried to leave but I had car trouble. She gave me keys and was going to let me drive Tony S's white Rolls Royce with red interior convertible home. I was trying to maneuver it to turn it around so I could get out with all of these trees around. Either her mother or Tony S's mother went in and talked to Dorothy S and were kind of, not scolding her but, telling her that she really had no idea what it was like be a single parent responsible for everything in the household. earning the income, trying to keep up the house, do a good job raising the children, etc. That she should have been more kind to me and respectful that I am doing all that and continuing my education.",stop see dorothy mistake home baking cooky church school cooky everywhere valentine day cooky stop greet hug anything like would wake life open door let go tried conversation misworded something ask go tell say go go back school content full time mom homemaker think great unfortunately word next thing wrong say could stay home live someone else would heartbeat best way word go say would want continue dreamwork get high much fun reward look smile respond anything try repair first sentence say think would great home full time take care house thing like young daughter tina come go school pick tara ask want go along got school basket bunny get sense tina dorothy ask still rabbit say get old develop adult coat become allergic say oh first coat wait second would fine think second coat say anymore rabbit basket get away chase hop tree hop around branch trouble catch finally start back able grab hold dorothy go school get tara come stuff hand include really big stuffed pink animal drove school sit front seat dorothy tina back get car go back way back house talk exercise stationary bicycle easy hour day good feel watch walk school get tara look like pregnant go ask go say anything would hate wrong would imply look like pregnant anyway talk great shape rid bike go find right leave tony use hollywood diet get home three men show play racquetball house three men din room family room area really talk much finally pick key say well sorry need go dorothy tried wait take little break could hug kind look keep play wave goodbye head door leave try leave car trouble give key go let drive tony white roll royce red interior convertible home try maneuver turn around could get tree around either mother tony mother go talk dorothy kind scold tell really idea like single parent responsible everything household earn income try keep house good job raise child etc kind respectful continue education,13.901942,13.673814,816,5,13,5,2,13,7,6,17,11,25,2

1758,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,371,2002-02-08,"I was with family members. It was women and children. We went to an amusement park. We were trying to decide what to do; whether to go ahead and ride some rides or wait for the men to join us. We did ride some rides. On one ride the operator stopped to let someone off and the rest of us in my family decided to get off as well. The men had finally joined us. My husband was a different nationality, dark skinned, about the same height. We weren't walking next to each other. he finally walked up next to me and put his arm around me. He didn't have a shirt on. Average size man. I put my arm around him. I thought it was odd that he didn't have a shirt on and I don't particularly care for men to be out in public without a shirt on. he was sitting and I was standing next to him. I leaned over and I kissed him on the cheek. He gave me a strange look. He said, I don't know why you do that. I said, why, what's the big deal. He just really disproved of any kinds of public displays of affection, even though it was a simple kiss on the cheek. We finally went to this big area, where you could get food and sit down at these long tables to eat. We were sitting there. We had two small children. I don't know if they were twins or simply very close in age. One was a girl and the other a boy. Through most of the dream I thought they were twins. It wasn't until the end of the dream that I questioned that. We were sitting in this dining area and my husband pulled out a gun and shot some people. Then he turned the gun on himself and shot himself in the chest but he didn't die right away. He lied there still for a minute. I was down on the ground next to him, perpendicular to him. I saw him raise his gun and I reached to try to get it away from him so he wouldn't shoot anyway else. Another man was sitting close by and saw. I was weak or injured or something and this other man managed to get the gun away from him. Then my husband died. We are walking toward our cars to go home. I was injured and walking with a cane. I would come to the top of the incline where the floor was polished. It was a really pretty colorful tile. Because it hurt for me to walk I thought I would just slide down the inclines. I would slide until I stopped or until I bumped into something in front of me. I was going to let my daughter stop me at the end. My sister said I couldn't do that because she's so little that I would just knock her over. Of course, she was right. Before we left the amusement park, after my husband died, one of my sisters said, well, Eddie's here. He'll be here for you now. He was either supposed to be my husband now or wanted to marry me. I thought he wasn't that attractive. I wasn't physically attracted to him. He seemed like a nice enough man. I was thinking about this as things progressed. I thought, well, gee with what I've been through you would think he would be a little more attentive to me right now. I was injured and having trouble walking and he didn't really do much to assist me. He didn't ever ask me if I was okay or needed help or anything. I thought that was kind of strange. I was back at my birth home and I was in my bedroom, my two children were in the boy's bedroom. Brian F was there. Daddy was there. I went outside for some reason. Aunt P and Aunt H came. I kind of looked over to Aunt P, hugged her, and started crying/sobbing. She was consoling me. Aunt H went ahead and went inside. I finally went back inside and went into the bathroom. There was something weird about the bathroom but I can't remember now what it was. Then I went back into my room. I just had my robe on and nothing on under it. I was lying on the bed crying. Daddy came in. He was lying on the bed next to me, talking to me and stuff. At this point, it felt like Mother was also dead. So he was talking about how this was difficult for me too. He kept wanting to touch my pubic hair. I kept pushing his hand away and I finally yelled, STOP! He said, why? I said, because it makes me really uncomfortable. He said, well it shouldn't. I said, but it does. He tried one more time and I angrily pushed his hand away and said, STOP IT! He finally got up and left. I was just lying there sobbing and Brian F was fixing lunch. grilled cheese and tomato soup. He asked me if I wanted some. I said, Yes I do. I'll be right out to help. I apparently stayed in my room too long. I went into the other room to my kids and they had been napping and they heard me come in and they both got up came to me. I was just thinking, how am I going to tell them that their daddy is dead. How am I going to raise these two children by myself? I already raised one child by myself. I don't want to do this again. My little girl, she was just a little bit shorter than the boy was. This is when they didn't seem like twins to me. I even questioned it in the dream. Which is really odd they were my children. The little girl asked me where Elly was. She said, mommy. I said, you spend so much time with Elly you think Elly is your mommy. I said, I'm mommy and I'm right here. I guess I didn't tell them about their daddy. I went out to the kitchen to help with lunch and I could see that everyone else was done and Brian F hadn't made anything for me. So, I got stuff out of the refrigerator and I was going to fix myself some lunch. I looked in the living room and Mother was sitting there. I stopped in my tracks. I looked again and I thought, it is mother. I thought, is she alive? So I walked in very slowly and leaned over her. She was sitting on the couch with her head back and looked like she was sleeping. I said, mother? She raised her head and said yes? I just started sobbing and she stood up and I hugged her and I told her that I thought she was dead and I told her how much I loved her.",family member woman child go amusement park try decide whether go ahead ride rid wait men join u ride rid one ride operator stop let someone rest u family decide get well men finally join u husband different nationality dark skin height walk next finally walk next put arm around shirt average size man put arm around thought odd shirt particularly care men public without shirt sit stand next lean kiss cheek give strange look say know say big deal really disprove kind public display affection even though simple kiss cheek finally go big area could get food sit long table eat sit two small child know twin simply close age one girl boy dream think twin end dream question sit din area husband pull gun shot people turn gun shot chest die right away lie still minute ground next perpendicular saw raise gun reach try get away shoot anyway else another man sit close saw weak injured something man manage get gun away husband die walk toward car go home injure walk cane would come top incline floor polish really pretty colorful tile hurt walk think would slide incline would slide stop bump something front go let daughter stop end sister say little would knock course right leave amusement park husband die one sister say well eddie either supposed husband want marry think attractive physically attract seem like nice enough man think thing progress think well gee would think would little attentive right injure trouble walk really much assist ever ask okay need help anything thought kind strange back birth home bedroom two child boy bedroom brian daddy go outside reason aunt aunt come kind look aunt hug start cry sob console aunt go ahead go inside finally go back inside go bathroom something weird bathroom remember go back room robe nothing lie bed cry daddy come lie bed next talk stuff point felt like mother also dead talk difficult keep want touch pubic hair keep push hand away finally yelled stop say say make really uncomfortable say well say try one time angrily push hand away say stop finally get leave lie sob brian fix lunch grill cheese tomato soup ask want say yes right help apparently stay room long go room kid nap heard come get come think go tell daddy dead go raise two child already raise one child want little girl little bit short boy seem like twin even question dream really odd child little girl ask elly say mommy say spend much time elly think elly mommy say mommy right guess tell daddy go kitchen help lunch could see everyone else brian make anything get stuff refrigerator go fix lunch look live room mother sit stop track look think mother think alive walk slowly lean sit couch head back look like sleep say mother raise head say yes start sob stood hug tell think dead tell much love,13.914548,13.652306,1208,6,15,4,10,14,9,6,16,15,28,2

Daddy had gone off by himself somewhere and was supposed to meet us at this one spot. We were sitting there for him for a long time. We realized we didn't have much time before we had to leave and I was frustrated that we had spent so much money on tickets to get in and we weren't going to have time to ride a single ride while we were there. We sat down and continued to wait. We finally decided that we needed to just go try to find him. I didn't want to go off by myself because I have trouble finding my way around there and not getting lost. We just all stayed together and it seemed to me that we were retracing our steps. I don't know. this is sketchy. We covered the whole park and didn't find him. We were going to see if they had any kind of a PA system where they could page him. We didn't know how we were going to find him. It was dark and they were closing up. The employees were starting to go home and we were getting really concerned. We didn't know how we were going to find him. I went in to use the restroom. They had very strange restrooms like in a foreign country where they don't actually have a toilet but rather just a drain in the floor. I heard some employees in the restroom talking. It seems as though someone was chasing us or I don't know. We kept going in and out of these hallways. We would accidentally end up in the men's room so we would just rush through hoping we wouldn't be noticed and finding our way out. But we kept weaving in and out of these, like hallways or something, and couldn't find our way out. It was almost like a maze. We would find our way out into a hallway of the building but then there wouldn't be anyplace else to go except a couple of very small doorways, like children's size doorways. Some child had set-up something like traps and told us at the end of that hallway that we had to go just one way. There is a lot missing and a lot that I simply cannot describe.

1762,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,375,2002-02-14,"I was asleep but experiencing extreme periodic limb movements, both arms and legs. I could hear someone say that I should get up and take some Advil or ibuprofen as that would help it tremendously. However, I couldn't wake myself up to do so. I thought I was crying out help me, help me. But no one was around to hear me. At first I was asleep in my own bed here at home and realized that there was no one else in the house to hear me. The scene shifted and I was in my bed at my birth home and I was thinking that BJ would be coming to bed soon and she would hear me and help me. The scene shifted again and I was an elderly person in a group home. I shared a bed with someone and there were four of us in the room. I was experiencing the same thing but the caretakers refused to give us anything. She was a very mean person. Several of us were experiencing health problems that kept us incapacitated and the caretaker preferred it that way. A new caretaker came and she gave us all the medications that we needed to feel better. We immediately began to feel better and we got out of bed and began doing things and going places. Several of us went to visit our families for the first time in a long time. One of the people died however, having been able to say their good-byes to their family. We were all happy for that person. Because of that death there was a change in bed partners. It wasn't necessarily same-gender bed sharing but there was no romantic or sexual activity either. I think over the course of the dream several people died, but they were all happy at the time of their death. This felt really good. I don't remember the exact transition of all the scenes. I was at this church. I don't recall my age. I was sitting in the pew not feeling well. I thought I was going to pass out. Just as I thought I was going to pass out, I saw myself slump over in the pew. I realized that I had died now also. The monsignor of the church was standing by my side. Even though he was alive, he could see me standing next to him. It was his job to help direct people who were newly crossing over from his church, so he had been given the gift by God to see the spirit of the person who had crossed, just as they had done so. He assigned them a spirit guide to lead them until the person was comfortable being on their own. Before I left with my spirit guide, the monsignor walked me around the inside parameter of the church. On the walls were banners in memory of those who had passed inside the church. He pointed out my banner. The banner said some very nice things about me. I didn't realize it was me, however, until he lifted it and showed me my name underneath. It was an incredible feeling. Especially as we floated into the air and overlooked the people and scenery beneath us. We floated over the cemetery. I saw Grandma F's headstone. I went to the ground and brushed away the grass and leaves. I spoke to her, hoping she would come out and speak with me, but she didn't. I was okay with that, thinking that it just wasn't meant to be, or at least not yet. I arose and continued floating around the cemetery. I saw Father F's headstone and went down to it. My spirit guide said that after passing we can have a wish come true that we know couldn't when we were alive. I really wanted to talk to Father F again so his spirit arose from the grave. My spirit guide left us alone. We had a wonderful chat. I went back inside the church and was looking at the banners again. This time I noticed one for BJ hanging there. There were a number of people/family members represented on her banner. I was surprised to see her banner. that she had died. But I also didn't know who all the people represented. The monsignor, who was now Father M, came up and told me that it was her children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. He also told me that she hadn't died yet, but that only I could see her banner as a sign that she would be joining me from that church. Her and her children came into the church for my funeral. They were very sad and I didn't want them to be sad for me. I was very happy. It felt wonderful to be free of the limitations and suffering of the physical body and a physical existence. God allowed her to see my spirit and communicate with her. It provided her with comfort, not only with my own crossing over but with the idea of her own eventual crossing. I did not tell her about her banner and what I knew about her crossing. I went back out to the cemetery for my burial. As I was hovering afterward, I saw my family wandering about the cemetery with the Kidwell family. Aunt A was pointing out that they had purchased burial spots so she, Uncle J, their children and their spouses, would all be buried together. I thought how unusual this was, at least according to the cemetery rules at St. Joe. I went back into the church. There was a mass going on and Father Marty was standing near an inside door. Another priest had just taken over as Monsignor of that parish. As I watched, I saw Father M's spirit leave his body. The new Monsignor directed him to me. I was to be his spirit guide. I welcomed him home. I took him around the parameter of the church and showed him the banners, and pointed out his own banner. I helped him get adjusted to floating. I took him to the cemetery. I told him about the ability to have one wish realized now that would not have been possible while in the physical body. Later, which must have been months or years later, I went to Father M's gravesite and saw that he was completely decomposed. All that remained were the things that he was buried in and with. Still, somehow, I was able to speak to him. I told him I wanted to be with him again, that I really missed him. He said, but don't you see, it's too late now!",asleep experience extreme periodic limb movement arm leg could hear someone say get take advil ibuprofen would help tremendously however wake thought cry help help one around hear first asleep bed home realize one else house hear scene shift bed birth home thinking bj would come bed soon would hear help scene shift elderly person group home share bed someone four u room experience thing caretaker refuse give u anything mean person several u experience health problem keep u incapacitated caretaker prefer way new caretaker come give u medication need feel well immediately begin feel well get bed begin thing go place several u go visit family first time long time one people die however able say good bye family happy person death change bed partner necessarily gender bed share romantic sexual activity either think course dream several people die happy time death felt really good remember exact transition scene church recall age sit pew feel well think go pas think go pa saw slump pew realize die also monsignor church stand side even though alive could see stand next job help direct people newly cross church give gift god see spirit person cross assign spirit guide lead person comfortable leave spirit guide monsignor walk around inside parameter church wall banner memory pas inside church point banner banner say nice thing realize however lift show name underneath incredible feeling especially float air overlook people scenery beneath u float cemetery saw grandma headstone go ground brush away grass leaf speak hop would come speak okay think mean least yet arose continue float around cemetery saw father headstone go spirit guide say pas wish come true know alive really wanted talk father spirit arise grave spirit guide leave u alone wonderful chat go back inside church look banner time notice one bj hang number people family member represent banner surprise see banner die also know people represent monsignor father come tell child grandchild great grandchild also tell die yet could see banner sign would join church child come church funeral sad want sad happy felt wonderful free limitation suffer physical body physical existence god allow see spirit communicate provide comfort cross idea eventual crossing tell banner know cross go back cemetery burial hover afterward saw family wander cemetery kidwell family aunt point purchase burial spot uncle child spouse would bury together think unusual least accord cemetery rule st joe go back church mass go father marty stand near inside door another priest take monsignor parish watch saw father spirit leave body new monsignor direct spirit guide welcome home take around parameter church show banner point banner help get adjust float take cemetery tell ability one wish realize would possible physical body later must month year later go father gravesite saw completely decompose remain thing bury still somehow able speak tell want really miss say see late,14.000193,13.738955,1140,4,18,4,11,13,15,7,19,15,30,2
1763,elizabeth,Elizabeth: a woman in her 40s,376,2002-02-16,"I was in the garage of a house. I went outside to look at the address to figure out where I was. I saw the number on the house was 914. The name on the street sign was Field St. I realized that I was lucid so I ran back into the house to get a piece of paper to right it down so I wouldn't forget it when I woke up. I thought this might be my next home. When I went back out to look again and make sure I had it right, as happens in dreams every time I looked at the number on the house it changed. It kept changing up from 400. I couldn't read the street sign anymore but I remembered that it was field. I wanted to find out where the house was. I found a piece of paper. At first I thought it said it was in CI, then I saw PT on the paper. As I was headed back to the garage I was noticing how nicely the property was landscaped. Near the garage door was an evergreen that was dying, however. It was as though it had vertical stripes of brown dead branches all around it. I leaned over to click off the outdoor light by the cord hanging from it. I remember thinking that I needed to get the evergreen replaced. I noticed that there were lights on inside the house, but behind the garage. I went inside and back to those rooms to see what the rooms were and why the lights were on. There were three different rooms. The first one was a laundry room. The second one had bins in the wall kind of like a post office box on the street, where you pull it open and drop the mail in. One of the bins was for mail and the other was for trash. I thought it was so cool to have a mail drop box there like that. The third room had the same kind of bins but these were for recycling. They were small narrow rooms. I left and went into the main part of the house. I was wondering around in awe, with the thought that this was going to be my future home in waking life so I was very interested in looking around. As I entered the main part of the house from the garage it had a huge open foyer with a very high ceiling. Directly in front of me was a wide staircase with banister on both sides, centered in the foyer. The stairs were carpeted, a print, maybe oriental pattern. I started up the stairs to see the other floors and a woman came in the house. I didn't know what to say to her because I didn't know who she was. She seemed to be Mexican perhaps. I thought she might be the housekeeper. I don't know how but I realized that I was the housekeeper and she was the woman of the house. She was giving herself a facial, I suppose, because she appeared to have a green facial mask on. I asked her if I could speak with her. She took me up to the first landing and sat in a chair and I sat on the floor at her feet. I asked her for her thoughts about dreams and the truth of their messages. She agreed that dreams are important and often given us factual information. I told her that I had dreamt that I was going to be living in this house. She didn't say anything. I asked her if she ever thought about having a live-in housekeeper. I said I could do that and proceeded to tell her the benefits to her of doing that. She agreed to the arrangement. I asked if I could look at the rest of the rooms in the house. The house seemed to have several stories but perhaps just 2 or 3 rooms on each floor. The house was fairly large though. When I was approaching one set of two doors, she mentioned her son who had died young. These were his rooms. I looked in one room and there was nothing in there but a bed. She was talking about his awards and accomplishments and that she hadn't touched his rooms since his death. I went to the other door. I felt as though I was going to fall off the landing but I'm not sure why. The door opened up from the floor and there was nothing in there. It didn't even seem to be a room. I was trying to clean the dirt off the door as I held it up. still afraid of losing my balance and falling off the landing. We went back downstairs. I did not see a living room or any bathrooms in the house. We went into the kitchen. Someone else was there now. Someone that I knew but I can't name them. The owner was getting something to drink. She had become a soda machine and she was spinning in circles before pouring herself something to drink. After she turned back into a person I asked her why she spun around before pouring her drink and she said she does that to mix it up before pouring. I poured myself some juice in a glass that looked like a miniature brandy snifter. I saw two little girls playing in a window, inside the house. It almost looked like an empty store window. It was carpeted and well lit but empty, except for the two little girls playing there. I learned that the owner's two sisters lived with her as well and that the two children belonged to each of them. This made me think that Matthew might be able to come and live there as well. She was scolding her sisters about something and they were all preparing for bed. Three men came in to talk to the owner. She introduced me to them. One was responsible for the house, the other for the landscape, and the third oversaw everything. I reminded myself that I should tell the landscaper about the dying evergreen. She gave me a key to the house and told me that I could move in the next day but I would need to start early and be done between 3 and 5 in the afternoon. I told her that was not a problem, as my family would want to be finished by then anyway. I was thinking that I needed to hurry home and call them so they could get there early in the morning. She pointed out to me to clean up the glasses that the others had left sitting before I went to bed. We remembered that she had not yet shown me my room. We went upstairs and she unlocked the door to my room. It was as small as a closet. Room for one twin size bed and a dresser. It did not even have a closet in it. There was an alcove in which I thought another twin size bed might fit. I asked her about doing that so Matthew could stay there as well. I think I woke up before she answered me. I was walking around outside just looking at the house. I was thinking that I wasn't that crazy about the looks of it from the outside but that it was beautiful on the inside. I also didn't like that it was only a one-car garage. The outside was red brick and had no windows that could be seen from the front or the left side. The garage was on the right side of the house. It did have interesting lines. Standing in front of the house, facing it, it sat on a corner, with the cross street on the right side of the house.",garage house go outside look address figure saw number house name street sign field st realize lucid run back house get piece paper right forget wake think might next home go back look make sure right happens dream every time look number house change keep change read street sign anymore remember field want find house find piece paper first think say ci saw pt paper head back garage notice nicely property landscape near garage door evergreen die however though vertical stripe brown dead branch around lean click outdoor light cord hang remember think need get evergreen replace noticed light inside house behind garage go inside back room see room light three different room first one laundry room second one bin wall kind like post office box street pull open drop mail one bin mail trash think cool mail drop box like third room kind bin recycle small narrow room leave go main part house wonder around awe think go future home wake life interested look around enter main part house garage huge open foyer high ceiling directly front wide staircase banister side center foyer stair carpet print maybe oriental pattern start stair see floor woman come house know say know seemed mexican perhaps think might housekeeper know realize housekeeper woman house give facial suppose appear green facial mask ask could speak take first land sit chair sit floor foot ask think dream truth message agree dream important often give u factual information tell dreamt go live house say anything ask ever think live housekeeper say could proceed tell benefit agree arrangement ask could look rest room house house seem several story perhaps room floor house fairly large though approach one set two door mention son die young room look one room nothing bed talk award accomplishment touch room since death go door felt though go fall landing sure door open floor nothing even seem room try clean dirt door hold still afraid lose balance fall land go back downstairs see living room bathroom house go kitchen someone else someone know name owner get something drink become soda machine spin circle pour something drink turn back person ask spun around pour drink say mix pour pour juice glass look like miniature brandy snifter saw two little girl play window inside house almost look like empty store window carpet well light empty except two little girl play learn owner two sister live well two child belong make think matthew might able come live well scold sister something prepare bed three men come talk owner introduce one responsible house landscape third oversee everything remind tell landscaper die evergreen give key house tell could move next day would need start early afternoon tell problem family would want finish anyway think need hurry home call could get early morning point clean glass others leave sit go bed remember yet show room go upstairs unlocked door room small closet room one twin size bed dresser even closet alcove thought another twin size bed might fit ask matthew could stay well think woke answer walk around outside look house think crazy look outside beautiful inside also like one car garage outside red brick window could see front left side garage right side house interest line stand front house face sit corner cross street right side house,13.716951,13.366304,1336,7,9,6,8,7,11,2,11,17,25,2
